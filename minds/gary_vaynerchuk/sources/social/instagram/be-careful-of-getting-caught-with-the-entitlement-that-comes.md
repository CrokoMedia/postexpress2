Be careful of getting caught with the entitlement that comes with putting in the work 
Now ..
Putting in the work is the most admirable and the most required but it doesn’t mean that there’s a financial or notoriety pay off at the end … that’s just what life is …

However … if you can escape the concept that you’re owed something for just “playing” aka “Life” .. and .. you fall in love with the work and realize you have to be good at it and create economic impact to have leverage to earn … well now you’ve got the perspective that can lead to the “win”
