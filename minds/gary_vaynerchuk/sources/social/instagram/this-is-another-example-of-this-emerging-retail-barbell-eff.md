This is another example of this emerging “retail barbell effect” that I’m focused on, with the rise of GEO and AEO and live shopping, The digital transformation is going to impact brands and retailers more than ever meanwhile, as a counter to this explosion of technology, you have this effect of real life, physical, tangible analog, executions like cafés and pop-up sampling events, pop-up shops, activations at concerts and sporting events experiential marketing so the explosion of trends that are hitting people that are selling things a.k.a. the things I just mentioned will lead to a whole New World by 2030 and most retailers and brands are not ready for the extremities on both the digital and the analog side of things
