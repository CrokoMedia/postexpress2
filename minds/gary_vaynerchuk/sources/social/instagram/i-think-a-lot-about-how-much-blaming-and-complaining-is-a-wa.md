I think a lot about how much blaming and complaining is a wasted energy & how much those energies hold people back from the opportunity to mend what’s bothering them or to start grownong more resilience .. this clip was from means the live audience debating at what age are you accountable for adjusting to the things you feel your parents did and building your life .. many said 16 some said 18 many more said 22 .. I like 25 

25 gives you 22-25 to reallly get your last whining out of the system and to taste real life and gives you a beat before you do the hard work of full accountability :) 

What age did you become accountable?
