Why wouldn’t I root for you… why wouldn’t I want you to win 🏅.. no one else’s winning, joy, success, happiness, shine is taking away from yours … too many people need to learn this truth. Envy and jealousy is destroying so many of your missions goals happiness out there, change your perspective, change your life
