People love to debate quality over quantity, but a reminder: quality is subjective. we all like different things. Raw, authentic, high polished, high fidelity, humor, beauty, strange, weird … But quantity is not debatable, so either you’re doing the reps or you’re not. I could not recommend more for people to have more accounts, more opportunities to post, and try different things. One piece of content can change everything.
