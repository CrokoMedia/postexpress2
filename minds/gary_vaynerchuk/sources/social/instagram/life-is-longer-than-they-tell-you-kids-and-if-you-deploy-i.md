Life is longer than they tell you kids … and if you deploy intention and patience along with an ability to tune “them” out …. You will live a much more joyful life 

Give yourself .. Grace … don’t be lazy or complacent .. but be patient and thoughtful ❤️❤️❤️

[Slide 1]
In your 20's...
people are gonna tell you to
"get serious" and "figure it out".
It is very important you don’t listen to them.

[Slide 2]
From 20-30, you should go for every dream you have.
This is the time to be the most high risk.

[Slide 3]
But, on your own dime not your parents.

[Slide 4]
Everybody’s got a chip on their shoulder to “prove” something to someone.

[Slide 5]
Which then leads to dumb sh*t and short-term gratification.
And that is always a losing formula.

[Slide 6]
This is the time to: learn, taste, play.
And realize how young you are.
You got time to “get there”.
