Kids in your 20’s please pay attention … this is the era of full offense while not blaming or asking anyone else for anything … the 20’s is the age range where you are a super hero and your risk tolerance is profound .. but it takes a winners mindset and that means ..
#1 humility 
#2 accountability 
#3 confidence 
#4 patience 
#5 tenacity

I’m cheering for you ❤️❤️❤️❗️
