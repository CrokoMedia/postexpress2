My friends we all need to consider more humility .. it’s humility and self confidence an self love that will allow you to navigate a world that has “so much to say” .. I don’t get mad at the “hate” I deeply compassion for their “anger/darkness” and I also don’t walk around earth and think I’m not privy to judgement or misunderstanding and lack of empathy deployed for .. it’s called .. living life and I’m not about to be overall effected by those who don’t know me nor do I have the audacity to think that I’m worth knowing that well. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
