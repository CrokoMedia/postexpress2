Listen I go very hard, in fact many people judge how hard I work and how many hours etc … but what many miss is that I always listen to my body and myself, I just happen to love what I do so it makes it very manageable but what makes it manageable for me is how much I sleep and how much I’m willing to just rest and Veg if I feel the need .. please friends stop judging yourself and start finding your balance 

Btw: more people need to figure out how to really work when they are in work hours. Impact of your hours matters more than how many you put in, obviously both is ideal for the big dreamers ‼️🍾💛✅

You shouldn't go hard 24/7.
Work when you work.
Rest when you rest.
