This is for the real ones .. this photo was just taken - and I want to give a huge shout out to the those who sacrifice for their loved ones for themselves for the truth of what it sometimes takes to “get there” 

I want all of you to hear 👂 this .. we live in a world where so much is documented and shared and more and more streamed live - but my friends I promise you .. the real ones who’ve built something that’s sustainable will tell you .. it all happens in the shadows and when most are sleeping or in pleasure or leisure .. so many see the glamor and the glitz and the pay off .. very few see the mud and dirt and blood and tears and sweat and pain and trials .. this has created the confusion 

So this post is for those in the shadows and the work and the dirt .. I see you and I admire you … 🍾
