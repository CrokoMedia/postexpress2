nothing matters to me more than making sure the next generation understands the patience, commitment, positivity and practicality that is required to have a fruitful meaningful career .. theres so so so many ways for individuals to start building “their careers” -Live Shopping, content creation, vibe coding apps, and streaming IRL like @2xrakai is doing … i cheer for u all heavy - keep going and YOU actually can do it.. it just takes real discipline, the kind most wont wan to deploy!
