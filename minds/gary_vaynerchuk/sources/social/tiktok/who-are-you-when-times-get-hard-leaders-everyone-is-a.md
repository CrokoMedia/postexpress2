Who are you when times get hard ???
Leaders … everyone is a good leader when times are easy … the question is … when times are stressful, do you stop the anxiety at your level and lead, or do you push it under you to the team?
If you’re a leader by nature, your #1 job is to stop pressure at your level, not deploy more of it underneath you.
