My top hiring tip at 0:19 🔑

My friends, hiring is a guessing game. 

I don't think I've ever checked a reference... It's not practical. Of course people are gonna list the 3 people that either most believe in them or love them, and/or the people that they've prepped to have their back. 

Listen, I don't think you need to hire just anyone and everyone .. but hiring is really just a logical guess, to the best of your ability, based on what you know about your organization and the series of questions you ask. 

Trust your intuition, your pattern recognition .. and if it doesn't work out, then you fire.
