If you have toxic employees within your organization, you’ll have other employees who are scared to have meetings with them. 

You’ll have people who are spending time navigating discussions with those employees than actually executing.

Your people will be spending time on politics. Not on execution.

When you build a culture where people feel safe and excited to come to work, they won’t worry about dealing with other employees as much.

When they’re not spending any time worrying, they’re spending time executing. If they don’t have to spend 15 minutes a day bickering or figuring out who’s trying to “ruin” them, they’re free to come up with new ideas and actually do the job they were hired to do. #garyvee
