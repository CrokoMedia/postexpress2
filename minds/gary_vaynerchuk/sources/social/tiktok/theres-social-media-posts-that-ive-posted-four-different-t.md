There's social media posts that I've posted four different times with a slightly different variation, and the first three got 70,000 views on average, and the fourth one got 6.3 million. How about I've got a campaign working in social? I want to take it to email and the first time I go I underperform. Am I open rates and conversion? I don't think that means you should not try again, right? We don't do enough post-production. We don't do enough nuance. We don't do enough context. We don't do enough third bite at the apples. I'm telling you, Mark, I'm going to. This is on my children's health. The subconscious inertia of television first hurts our industry, brother.  #garyvee #socialmedia
