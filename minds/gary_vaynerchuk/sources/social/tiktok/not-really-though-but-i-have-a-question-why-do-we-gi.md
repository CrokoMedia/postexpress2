Not really though … BUT .. I have a question .. why do we give a pass to the generations we never knew or didn’t know well … sooooooo much anger towards partners when some of you know that mom and dad are like that because granny and pop pop weren’t way to them an so on and so on ..

You … YOU … are capable of stopping 🛑 the resentment.. and maybe deploying some
Compassion, empathy, sympathy towards your folks and their upbringing and difficulties might actually help you forward …
It’s worth th debate 💚💙
