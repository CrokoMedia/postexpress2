New technologies win. Like people held on to candles and lanterns. But electricity won from the will to I. We will go. When the canvas was invented, all the artists said it wasn't real. They said if you make art on a canvas, it's not real. You must make it on a building. The amount of people that just heard that, and they think that's real art and like an NFT. No way. The fun thing to think about is do we go in hyper acceleration of AI 2 or 3 day to day work week? What the fuck does that mean? Five days of leisure? I don't know, these are all the fun questions I think about constantly.
