You can build an empire. The next year, $1 billion corporations are going to be based on a human being. Mr. beast is selling chocolate all over the world on his personal brand. Logan Paul and Jake Paul and their brands, especially Prime and Ksi's brand. The creator is the studio. We're a production company. We made this physical comic and we sell it on live streaming. I started a wine brand called Empathy Wines on the back of my personal brand, and in 18 months had a hefty eight figure exit. It's similar to like building your brand on Instagram, but then going and standing up a Patreon Substack. But in those scenarios, those platforms still take some of the action when that's built on a decentralized server, you own all the money. You keep 100% of that dollar, not 90 or 80% of that dollars. When I wrote Crush It for the ones that follow me in the late it was like, hey, I think we can all make 50 K on the internet. We should check this out. Show it. Crush it was. You can have a life making content on the internet. Now I'm telling you, you can build an empire on the back of a human.
