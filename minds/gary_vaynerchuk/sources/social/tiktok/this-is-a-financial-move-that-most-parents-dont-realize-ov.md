This is a financial move that most parents don't realize.
Overcoddling, making it bougie, making it nice for them is fine. 3, 4, 7, 9, 13 years old. But the second you take your kids off the payroll is when they become real.
I see my son already becoming real cuz I'm done buying him sports cards.. he's now flipping his own sports cards to buy new sports cards. And I've watched him transform in the first year already around that. It just became real life for him.
You can't fake environment, but you can definitely change the calculus on them. And that's fully based on money.
It's not cutting them off emotionally. It's cutting them off financially. #parenting
