40% revenue growth in Q3 for a national Restaurant is insanity and it came from 1 commercial which wasn’t even a commercial, it was a social media post ORGANICALLY .. Aka no media spend to give it more reach

We live in the era of advertising where the creative itself creates the reach due to its relevance to the end consumer .. this is a remarkable phenomenon known as “interest media” and it’s changing the entire landscape on Madison Avenue and the way Fortune 500 companies need to advertise, and it creates an enormous opportunity for individuals and small businesses and startups. It’s what VaynerMedia specializes in and why VaynerX has exploded in the last five years .. are you on this train ?????
