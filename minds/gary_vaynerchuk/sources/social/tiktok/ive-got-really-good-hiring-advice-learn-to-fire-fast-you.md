I've got really good hiring advice: learn to fire fast.
You guys have your egos tied up in your hiring. You think you're so good at hiring and then you hire somebody and they're bad, but you pretend they're not, because firing them admits that you were wrong. So it's your own ego that's holding you back
My friends, we all make mistakes hiring … it’s a reallllly hard game. Check your ego at the door. You're not that great at hiring, but good news: nobody is.
Hire fast. Fire faster. Promote fastest.
