Put positivity in your f*cking ears 👂

Listen, you know what to do... there's only work. But you grew up in a way .. environment, parents, DNA, that hasn't let you "get there" yet. But the fact that you're here following me, watching this video, or reading this .. it's just a matter of time now. 

What you need to do is keep pressure on it. 

The reason I never change my tune .. the reason I'm getting so many people to do things is because I don't waiver. It's constant offense. I'm gonna pound you every day, multiple times a day with the same f*cking thing .. it never changes. 

Luckily for me there's new platforms so it feels like I'm saying something new because sh*t's changing, but it's the same thing. And you'll just eventually get there.. What you need to do is keep paying attention to me or others that sound like me so that it becomes your norm .. it becomes your oxygen, there are no other voices. 

And eventually, just like when you jump off a diving board 🏊‍♂️ into a pool, just like when you kiss somebody for the first time, just like anything else you ever did in life, eventually, you get there and you do it and you never look back. 

So the key 🔑 is to suffocate yourself into pressuring yourself to have no other options. The reason I'm worth listening to is because I'll do that for you, and then you don't need me anymore ;) ❤️❤️❤️
