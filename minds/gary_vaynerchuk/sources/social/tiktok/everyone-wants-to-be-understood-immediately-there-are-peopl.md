Everyone wants to be understood immediately. There are people who have full force to be interviewed. Never met me. And I understand if you grew up in a household where over-the-top ness and cursing were demonized, how can you possibly like me at first? If your parents taught you that self-promotion and be quiet like you don't have to put yourself out there, your work should speak for itself. I think it's a beautiful virtue, you know, speaking in a respectful manner. I think these are nice things. I am not that I am very out there. I'm very Jersey potty mouth, but it's me and I'm okay with people misunderstanding me at first.
