So many thoughts about this post
#1 too many of you want to have it figured out, at the @vaynerx holiday party I had a young man who worked at the venue come talk to me, he had "it" but he was 22 and said he didn't know where to go with his life and career but he knew he could do "things" my friends, you don't need to have it figured out but you had to act.. you have to be in motion, you had to execute.. what does that look like ?
A) meet new people, say hello to people in the real world, DM people and ask for 5 Minutes if their time, 99% will not respond, you're working for the 1%
B) just do the thing ….. post, launch the website, the substack, the podcast, the t shirt, the song ect .. jump on the pool
C) you're allowed to change your mind.. why is this important? Because when you realize you can pivot, adjust, react to whatever is happening it makes the going for it less daunting ..
2026 is here.. do you really want to keep debating ???
Or do you want to finally "taste" what living feels like ?
