17 years ago I was talking personal brand and making content and coming from an authentic place and back then trying to warn people that this social media thing would not allow you to hide 🙈 … what’s crazy is there’s still so much room for more growth, every day 100’s of new people post the price of content that will change their life .. like I said 17 years ago .. please make it authentic to you, real, how you feel today and wha lt you’re into today … even if it’s not what for you followed yesterday … follow your dreams .. my current dream is to build the next Pokemon and marvel ..it’s called @veefriends and I’m actually live right now @ veefriends.com/whatnot -
