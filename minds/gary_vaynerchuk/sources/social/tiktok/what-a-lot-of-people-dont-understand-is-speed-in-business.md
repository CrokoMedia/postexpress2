What a lot of people don’t understand is, speed in business comes from great internal culture. The biggest things that will make your company go fast is 1) continuity and 2) lack of politics. That’s why it doesn’t matter how “great” an employee’s numbers are if he or she makes all the other employees miserable. If they constantly spread negativity or drag other employees down, it doesn’t matter to me how good they are on paper. If you’re the CEO of a company, it’s imperative that you go audit every single employee in your company, and figure out which ones make the other employees miserable. It doesn’t matter if it’s your number one salesperson, your best developer, or even your co-founder.
Cancer spreads.
And if you have people in your company that are cancerous, you have to get rid of them no matter how much revenue they bring in.
