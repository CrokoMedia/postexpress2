Do you know that most people's negative opinions of AI in a commercial, in content, is all actually predicated on their own fear that they're going to lose their job because of AI? Some people think it's slop. I'm like, okay. Like one man's slop is another man's dinner, right? There's a really funny saying that modern parenting has for little kids that says, "Don't yuck, their yum." That's awesome. That's how I see life. I don't understand people's audacity to think that people should see the world the way they see it.
