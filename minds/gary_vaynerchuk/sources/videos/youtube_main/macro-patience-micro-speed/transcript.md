# Macro Patience, Micro Speed

[Speaker A] Hello, I'm Bart. I practiced my question so many times that I lost my voice. So that's.
[Speaker B] That'S amazing.
[Speaker A] First of all, I would like to thank you because I started my career as an entrepreneur by trying to build the next Facebook. But thanks to your speeches on self awareness, I came to realize that I lose sleep over borrowing hundreds, hundred euros from my brother. So, you know, I probably will never build the next Facebook having that in mind. So a year ago I started to build a data migration company, you know, organically. So I landed a big customer and now I get paid every day and I'm developing my stuff and we went live in production in Chile in December and now this year for the same company, we will do usa, Mexico and Canada. So it's going really great. But my question to you was you talk a lot about patience. So. But you also talk sometimes about speed and patience. For me that would be, you know, continue with the same with the one.
[Speaker B] Can I answer you real fast and you'll understand it forever?
[Speaker A] Okay.
[Speaker B] Macro, patience. Micro speed. Yeah, okay, let me expand on it because that didn't work. Fuck. No, no, hold on, hold on, hold on. Back, back, back. Macro, patience. You're a young man building something meaningful, a relationship, a business. It takes 10, 20, 30 years. On your day to day work, you have to be fast with the clients. They email you, you email them back like your day to day. But your vision, what you want to achieve in life, you're not going to build it in one year. And so many people have it reversed in the day to day, they're slow. And then the macro, they want their business to be huge the next day, so you need to reverse it.
[Speaker A] So if you have to make the decision between, in my case, building a better framework or focusing on that, or trying to find more customers, what would you advise? Knowing that I don't need the money of new customers right now?
[Speaker B] Both.
[Speaker A] Okay, thank you.
[Speaker B] And so here's an answer of both. Number one, how hard are you working? I don't know. If you're working 12 hours a day, I feel like you could work 17 if you want. Right. Number two, if you're working every hour and you can't work more with the money that's coming in, too many young people and too many young businesses, when they start having money come in, take it for themselves. They want to buy a good watch, they want to buy a good car, they want to buy fancier shoes. What I would do is when my first money. So here's my story. This is not advice I'm giving just for fun. This is my life. I was. I walked in my dad's store. It did $3 million a year, 10% gross profit, $300,000 in profit before expenses. We had no money. I was making $40,000 a year, $37,400 actually. And I built that business from 3 to 45 million in the first kind of four or five years. And five years later, five years later, this is doing $45 million in sales, and I'm making $40,000. This is the advice I gave. And by the way, I was in my 20s and a guy, the exact time. If you're making that kind of money that you want to use it to do guy things, right? I put it back into the business. I hired four more managers, six more managers, seven more managers. I did more advertising. I built a business. So if this money's coming from Chile and the US And Mexico, hire people, then you can do both.
[Speaker A] Okay. Thanks.
[Speaker B] You're welcome.
[Speaker A] Ra.
