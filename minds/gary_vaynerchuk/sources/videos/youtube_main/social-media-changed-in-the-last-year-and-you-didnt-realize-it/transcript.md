# Social Media Changed in the Last Year (and you didn't realize it)

[Speaker A] The 1/2 economy is the thumbnail, the screen. We're living in a world that's so fast. How do you capture somebody for one second so that you can have them for one year before I can get people to really know about the depths of how I think about mental mindset, kindness, bringing value. Before you do all of that, you have to know how to get somebody to know you for a second. And that's the economy we live in now. Thumbnail on Netflix is the 1 second economy. The thumbnail on social is the 1 second economy. The first words you say when what's the thumbnail look like? How do you win on the 1/2 economy? On Spotify, on Soundcloud, if you're a rapper, on TikTok Live, if you're a streamer or Twitch. How do you do that in thumbnail first 3 seconds? The stuff we work on on the team, Gary. So the whole ecosystem. Good morning, Good morning, Good morning everybody. Welcome to episode 101. Great to see all of you. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Ask a question in the chat. Use five question marks. We're here to answer your questions. Do I think there's AI startups that are overvalued? For sure. But there was a social media bubble that they said that's because there were 500 social media networks getting tens of millions of dollars in funding at the time. Tens of millions felt like hundreds of millions. And Bebo and Orchid and all these other things, Peach, Plum, Social Cam, they all went out of business. But Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat and TikTok went on to become some of the biggest companies in the world. There is no AI bubble. There's an AI startup bubble. But artificial intelligence is about to fundamentally change the world forever. So don't get it twisted like AI is not going backwards. There was a NFT bubble for individual projects. But veefriends is going to be one of the most significant digital collectibles of all time. And the blockchain is going to matter forever. Joe Burrow to the Jets. Maybe I'd be interested. All right, let's get into the questions. Who are. Who's got the first question? Looks like Raghav. Fire away, bro.
[Speaker B] You've been saying that you can't get the 1 second economy out of your head. Can you elaborate on that?
[Speaker A] What do you mean by that? So I've been thinking a lot about this. I've been talking about internally. This is probably an internal question about this one second economy. I'm actually writing a new book kind of. Cause I haven't started. We got some real work to do called the Individual Empire, right? And this is the concept of like, it's kind of like the final chapter of Crush It. It's like in 2009 I talked about, I think that you can make a living by being a personality on the Internet. Talking about being a creator and an influencer long before it existed. Didn't even have the words for it. Did not use that if you read Crush It. Now I'm writing a book called the Individual Empire because I think now we're at the end state where a human can be a corporation. I would argue that I am. That I'm gary vee. Vaynerchuk vaynermedia. Vayner X is a $350 million a year business built on the back of my personal brand. And then execution, empathy, wines, resi and definitely veefriends. When I build this to be the next Marvel and the next Pokemon will be on the back. Logan Paul in prime. Steven Bartlett, Mr. Beast. You're starting to see Alex Cooper, Alex Earl. You're seeing humans become corporations. That's the Individual Empire. The one second economy is what's happening right now in real life. Like, why are there 3,000 people watching right now? One, it might be because we're not on a retail show. We're on a regular stream. I know that caught Courtney's attention. This is not a thousand, right? Like, it's. It's because what I'm doing, whatever I'm doing right now in format, in content, it's working to capture this. As you guys all know, this first time, we're over 3,000. Because we're not on a commerce, right? We're not on Commerce. There's 3,100 people watching right now. Did I know how to use TikTok Live properly? Am I engaging with people in the one second? The thumbnail, the screen? We're living in a world that's so fast. How do you capture somebody for one second so that you can have them for one year, Right? How do you capture somebody for one second so you can have them for one year before. Before I can get people to really know about the depths of how I think about mental mindset. Kindness bringing value, you know, Joey V, Joey Vee. Gary is old news. I like that. Hopefully Joey V is new news. Everybody go follow Joey Vee. He says I'm old news. Maybe he's new news. So, you know, before you do all of that, you have to know how to get somebody to know you for a second. And that's the economy we live in now. You know, the thumbnail on Netflix is the 1 second economy. The thumbnail on social is the 1 second economy. The first words you say, and obviously the 1/2 economy might be a little bit hyperbolized, but we're definitely in a 10 second economy. After notice how you all just reacted with head nods after 10 seconds, you kind of know, right? So anyway, you're just trying to bring value. Try to teach people how to win in the 1/2 economy. What's the first words out of your mouth on your first podcast? What's the thumbnail look like? How do you win on the 1/2 economy? On Spotify, on sad Soundcloud, if you're a rapper, on TikTok Live, if you're a streamer or twitch or kick. How do you do that in thumbnail first 3 seconds? The stuff we work on on Team Gary for shorts and Snapchat Spotlight. So the whole ecosystem. So that's where I'm at with it. Let's keep it going. Fire away. Narea, is there anything you're living through right now that you're learning that you.
[Speaker B] Wouldn'T yet trust yourself to teach?
[Speaker A] Yeah, I would say candor. I'm still like, I talk about this a lot. Like, my candor is still like, just, okay, it was atrocious seven years ago, especially somebody running a company of my size. I would talk about the power of candor. But teaching on, like, you know, like, I like to talk about things I'm really good at. Collectibles and selling stuff or marketing or mindset or happiness or perspective. All my content, as you all know, is about that all day. All of you that are watching right now, you guys know that's what I like talking about. But candor is something I can talk about. It's valuable. But I would argue it's not my strength. RR says you're my mentor. You don't even know it. I appreciate it. I want you to know I do know it. What makes me want to make content every day is knowing so many of you have extracted value out of the things that I've said or the stuff that I put out. And I just want everybody to know I'm just a vessel or a vehicle of what's happened before me. My mom taught me this. She got it from somewhere. The world has been talking about these principles forever. So I'm nothing new, everyone. I'm just brave enough to say it. In the face of scaled global pushback, the only thing I'm doing Different is I'm doing it publicly on the Internet and social media where 890 people can give you, you know, feedback in a way that didn't exist years ago. So let's keep it going.
[Speaker B] Ragha Waseem asks, I built an AI avatar in the Dubai real estate niche. My hooks, scripts and visuals are solid, but after 12 reels, I'm capped at 200 views. I'm questioning whether the issue is weak.
[Speaker A] First 12, keep going.
[Speaker B] When you test something new, how do you isolate whether the format itself is affecting friction of it or the content simply hasn't had the time to our intention.
[Speaker A] What he's struggling with, I outwork right now. He's like, I've done 12. It's not working. Should it be something else? My answer is both keep doing the format you've got and add another format that costs more work. The reason I'm good at and and everyone else loves or is because of my work ethic and is harder. Oh, we're getting somewhere, friends. The reason the answer to this question is make more stuff. Like, okay, I've got a format. It's not working right. Taco Politico. Didn't your father own a liquor store? He did and I built it for him and I got underpaid for 12 years building it for him. So that's that. Like, would have made more money if I did anything else besides building my dad's liquor store for 12 years and left with nothing. So anyway, back to it. He needs to outwork it. I don't know if his format's right or not. He's only done 12, so he needs to do another 200. But if he's already questioning if it's right, he needs to do those 200 and more stuff. This is not AI Pine Lodge Foundation. It's good to see you. That's it. Outwork your curiosity. You like that one? You like that, right? It's real. Outwork your curiosity. Like outwork your insecurity. Like, ah, I don't have it figured out, but it might be right. Like that's it, my friends. I appreciate that, Raz. I think it's real. Uribe says aha moment, right? A lot of people, it's my post this morning. You guys saw it. I wrote a nice little thing this morning. You know, kid came up to me yesterday at the party was like, I really got it. He's working as security at Tao where we are last night. He's like, I see people doing stuff and I know I can do it. I'm like, so do it. He didn't like that, right? He liked sitting in like, oh, I can. You guys, you know what this is? A lot of you like, talking about that you could be doing what someone else is doing and. Cause that makes you feel better, but you're not doing it. I lived that in physical fitness. Like, I really thought at 38, that I was gonna get a six pack like that. I'm like, oh, I could do that. I'll just get discipline. I'll lock in. Well, here I am. 12 year literacy letter. I don't have it. It's fucking hard, you know? You know, like, it didn't make me feel better. I didn't feel like I was. Some people feel like they're doing something by saying they can do it. Some of you motherfuckers think you're doing something by saying that you can do it. Oh, they got lucky. I can do that. Mm. You're not doing anything by talking. Listen, everybody. I might change this from tea with GaryVee to, like, mornings of Ahas with Gary Vee. Like, this is about Ahas. I'm here for ahas. I'm here like, aha. Like, I'm here for ahas. Elevated says, Dang, you're right. Yeah, bro. Yeah, bro. A lot of you were like, I can do that, but that's not doing something. And like, you know, Carter Weston, I'm sorry you think that you're. I will prove that wrong, bro. You know, vfriends is a scam. You go to ebay and check out what's going on with these. You don't think that, like, again, people more focus on tearing down than building up. Tearing down someone else makes you feel better about you. Wrong. You know? I don't know, man. I want you guys doing stuff to make yourself happier. I want you to understand why you're unhappy or what's hurting. Like, that's, you know, I'm excited for you. Look at this. Joey V. Gary, I dropped out of college and sold my company for 25 million. Makes me so happy, man. So happy for you, Joey. One piece. TCG's red hot. Victor Ramirez, one piece. Back to being very hot again. Yeah, positivity. Dave's right. Positivity takes more energy and bravery. It's very easy. Do you know why everyone shits on everyone on the Internet? Because it's easy. It's so easy. It's so easy for me to open up my Instagram right now or my TikTok and just be like, you suck. It's much harder to put my phone down, go do something, and have someone come to me and. And say, you're great. That's why there's so much hate on the Internet. So easy. Cause people think they're tough, but they're super weak. People that spew hate on the Internet think they're tough talking that shit. I'm keeping it real. Fuck you. No, no. You're a pussy. How about that? Real talk. All right, let's keep it going. How would you build a community from.
[Speaker B] Scratch in this current environment?
[Speaker A] This is the easiest time to build community in the world. I would do it by doing what I'm doing right now. Go on TikTok live and talk to people. I got a big one. I am envious of all of you that have less than a thousand followers on TikTok. I am envious because I love the climb and the build. And if I had a thousand, it would mean that more likely I'd be not very busy or maybe I'd be busy cause I'm doing something. But I'm not gonna assume that. But I am envious for the people that have less than 1,000. Because going live on TikTok right now, just going live is one of the great opportunities in the world. And if you have less than a thousand, you would only have 13, 9, 6, 33, 41 people in the room. And you could go deep. I wish right now. And I could, but it's hard. Cause it goes so fast, you know, I wish I could go deep with everyone, but I can't, you know. And that, you know, would be awesome. 50 people going deep is how you build a community. So how would I build a community? I'd go on TikTok Live, have the algorithm and the FYP send me people, bring them value on video and start from scratch and build up every day and go live as often as I could. This has never been easier. All right, let's keep it going.
[Speaker B] Perfumes is the number one trending product category on TikTok in the last 30 days. Pinterest also has search trends among Gen Z and millennials, where there's rise in search for niche perfume collections. Scent layering, perfume notes, like a lot of like niche fragrance formulas. Is there a reason you're seeing that?
[Speaker A] Yeah. Boys are trying to hook up, bro. Men are trying to smash. Boys are poised. It's that time of year, By the way. By the way, y'. All. Many things change in the world and some things don't. Boys are trying to get it. Yeah, that's all I got for you. That, that, you know again, a deeper answer to that because by the way, a year ago, boys were trying to smash too and it wasn't trending as much. It's content on the Internet. TikTok Shop is changing the game right now in real time. TikTok Shop is changing the game so people are selling more of that. Influencers are changing what people are into. Do you know why people were clean shaven in the late 90s and not bearded out? It was called friends. Do you all know why people literally in 99 nobody had facial hair. In 1999 in America, nobody had facial hair. It was called friends. That's what was cool. Those boys were clean shaven. We were clean shaven. Yeah. Dave said mind blown. You know, so like things, you know. By the way, one of my predictions is clean shaving will come back because we've been and bearded some sort of facial hair mustache life for so long that we get tired. This is my number. I call this the jeans theory. We go from tight ass jeans to baggy jeans to tight ass jeans to baggy jeans every seven to 12 years because we get bored. We go long hair, short hair, long hair, short hair, facial hair, non facial hair, perfume, not perfume, cologne, not perfume. By the way, I said recently, including me, I might go a whole year just wearing suits. I've been casual for 25. I'm starting to be like, man, I just want to wear a suit every day for a year. I think we've gone so casual. I mean, we look like bums at the airport. Has anybody ever seen an airport? We're bumming it, we're slobbing it. I love it because I'm casual like that, right? Wearing a cap. I'm casual like that. But I really think we are in a place where we might go. Like people gonna want to dress up and like do it. Like you can just see things changing. Things are always changing. So anyway, let's keep it going.
[Speaker B] 2026 is around the corner.
[Speaker A] If you could pick up one different.
[Speaker B] Trait for people to leave into for the upcoming year.
[Speaker A] I got a bunch which will. I got one. Friends, this is my one. It's so funny. I literally took this off the shelf yesterday because it's been on my mind. Friends, this is the curious crane. Friends, this is the curious crane. This is a bee friend called the curious crane. I highly recommend you find curious crane stuff. You know, go to this place and go look up curious crane. I want everybody to get into curiosity in 2026. Curiosity will create the outcome you're looking for. Curiosity will create the outcome you're looking for. Bobby Libs. That makes me so happy. Curiosity will create the outcome you're looking for. Why? What? Why what? Why what? Real fast says curiosity kill the cat in that story. Curiosity blended into nosiness and that killed the cat. Curiosity didn't kill the cat. Nosiness and not minding your own fucking business killed the cat. That's actually the other thing I want for everybody in 2026. I wish I had mind your own fucking business back in veefriends. You want to really get happy, Everyone mind your own fucking business. Your fucking two cents on everybody's life means I don't give a. Do you really think your opinion on Hailey Bieber and Justin Bieber's life should be fucking shared, you fucking nosy bitch? You want to get real happy? Live my life that my mom taught me. It's not even mine. What my mom taught me, stay out of people's business. Let me say it a different way that's not as aggressive. Have compassion and empathy for others. What they might be going through behind closed doors or in their mind that you don't know which might be leading them to doing behaviors that you judge. Uh oh, that's a little more therapist way to do it. Let me give you the street kid. Mind your own fucking business, dick face. And now let me give you the compassionate uncle advice. How about you don't know what's actually going on in someone else's life? So before you jump to conclusions of why they suck, how about having some sympathy, compassion, and empathy to maybe they're going through something anyway. Who is this? What's your best garage sale found? I found like 8,000 Broadway playbills from the 1940s to the 1980s for 20 bucks. That was like 10K in eBay for my nephew, the only man that you know. So everyone, I hope that really helped that little rant, because that stuff is real. That stuff is real. Thank you for that, everybody. All right, let's keep it going. Next questions.
[Speaker B] I'm 28. I own an SMB doing about 2.5 million. I do all our marketing. Social is crushed. My father has sold advertising his whole life. He wants to put dollars into traditional banner ads and direct mail, etc. I want to do proven organic social. The answer is purple. But what does that combo look like.
[Speaker A] That you do organic social first and then you run media against it for performance? There's a middle ground. Organic social first, then paid media for commercial Conversion on CAC and LTV and roas. That should help you and dad. Awesomely, awesomely, awesomely. Execute. Emery asking, how do I do on bitcoin? Well, I bought it in 2014. Didn't buy enough, but I've done well on bitcoin. I'm very bullish on it. I mean, I mean I really had it. I had it in 2014. I had it, I had it. But the good news is I invested in Coinbase in 2014 as a hedge, as a parallel path, and I bet big on that and that's worked out lovely. What vacation spot would you like to visit? Mr. Eyebrow says there's not much left. And historically I'm not someone who wants to see the pyramids or Big Ben. I don't want to go sightseeing. Like, me and Trane were in Portugal after I was done with my talk train. It's like, oh, I'm going to walk around. Like, he hadn't traveled a lot. He hadn't traveled a lot. You know, it was the first time you were in Europe, right? Yeah. So he was like, like walking around and I was like, man, this is the first time trains in Europe and he's walking around. He's already walked around Europe more than I have in my life. I'm like in and out, working in the hotel room. I'm not, I'm not into travel. I am into relaxation. Like, I do like to go for like a one week vacation in a beachy place and just lay and rest my body and my mind. I'm into that. I'm more beach and just eat and rest and sleep, listen to music, maybe read a book once a year. More so than a meditation or health and wellness routine. Definitely more than sightseeing. Man, I hate sightseeing. Heavy. I fucking hate sightseeing. Sightseeing is the worst. And yet why? Because I'm not. That's where I don't have curiosity. I don't want to go out of my way to like look at something, be like, oh, nice a thing. On the flip side, so many people love it and I'm so pumped for all of you. Like, I do want to go. Like, I would love to go to March Madness Final Four weekend, hang around for three days talking sports, watching basketball games and going home. Love. That's an experience for me. Some, you know, everyone sees things differently. Like, I get, by the way, this is my thing. By the way, everyone back to compassion, empathy, sympathy. I don't like to go and see things, but I'm pumped For people that like to go and see things, I wish we had more love like that in the world. A lot of people, when someone likes to do something they don't like, they like shit on them. I don't like surfing. I don't like golfing. But my brother loves golfing, and I love that for him, you know, like, I don't know why. Again, this goes back to that judgment. Your judgment's destroying your happiness, my friends. Your judgment is destroying your happiness. It's like politics. I am blown away by people's belief that the way they see the world is the way that every other human should see the world. I curse like a sailor. But when someone in here left because I cursed a little bit ago, and they're like, no, I don't like that guy, I understand them because they might have grown up in the south and their grandma told them cursing is the devil and that's their life. And I respect that. But I fucking like to curse because I'm a Jersey boy from the fucking dirt. That's what we do. You know, like, Emery, good for you. I judge and then catch myself. We all. It's a natural human trait. We have to all unlearn so many of you's DNA and the way you were parented, you've got to unlearn your things. Let me teach you something I'm unlearning and working on right now. I am working on my glute med on the left side. All of my back issues. Finally, at 50, it's been diagnosed everything bad and probably a lot to do with why I don't have a left hand in basketball. Everything bad is because. Is the glute med the one on the outside is the max on the inside? I don't know which one's on the inside. The outer part. Friends. Fitness friends. Which is the glute med and the glute max. What's on the outside? I think the glute med. I don't know. Anyway, I am unlearning outside glute mead. Beautiful. I'm learning how to not use my adductors and my Ql. And my Ql was used so much that I've had a bad back since I was 18. It would lock. The ql would lock. I'm now learning we're going through heavy therapy. Me and Mike are working every day to activate my glute med. My glute med. My outer left glute has not actually functioned. My brain and it have not been connected and everything else was making Me, functional. I'm learning. I'm literally learning that you can learn to undo your hate. You can learn to undo your insecurity. That's an emotional. I'm doing a physical one. I've crushed the physical stuff. I could have. My dad's cynical as shit. My dad deploys judgment at scale. My dad's answer to everything is no. Mine is maybe to yes. We've all got stuff. So anyway, everyone got it. Gary, do you think 34 is too old to start over? Mitch, I started over at 34. 22 to 34, worked for my father, got paid dick, built a huge business for him. Proudest moment of my life. Borderline little unsubconscious resentment because I was 34 and I was like, man, I did a lot of. I started over at 34. 53 is not too old. Anna Banana, 26. Like Sidney Frank started Grey Goose at 73. Colonel Sanders. KFC was started by a man in his 60s. He started at 60. KFC. Happy days. Good to see you. Yeah. Leah says I'm 51 and life 2.0 is addicting. Damn straight. Damn straight. Justin says, love the positive bias who stumbled on here and is loving it and wants to hang here. Because this is the positive part of the Internet. Congrats, everybody. You found the positive part of the Internet. Congrats, everybody, you found the positive part of the Internet. I am here strictly for two things. To get you happy, to make you money, and by the way, the first one's way more important than the second one. I am strictly here for two things, you motherfuckers. To get you happy and to get you money. And let me tell you how you do that. You start getting in the thumbs business versus the fingers business. The second I get y' all who just stumbled on me to stop blaming everybody. To stop blaming everyone. To stop blaming everyone and to start blaming yourself. It's counterproductive. You're like, damn, if I blame myself. Maybe I get depressed because I'm shitting on myself. No, no. Being accountable doesn't get you to depression. Being accountable is very easy to be while still equally loving yourself. That's called giving yourself grace for how you got here. Have you given yourself grace? Somebody just said in here, gary, I'm broke. I need your help. It went fast. I saw it. Don't be sad that you're broke. Know that today's the day you can be not broke. TikTok affiliate. Who here knows what TikTok affiliate is? I need all of you to chatgpt or Google how to become a TikTok affiliate. Somebody in this room of the 1359. Somebody in this room is about to hear a piece of advice in the next 13 seconds that's gonna change their life. I need you to become a TikTok affiliate. I believe out of the 1368100 of you will and I believe six of you will be successful. And that's great by me because the other 94 to try something else you'll do. Congratulations for finding the positive part of the Internet. You found me. We're here. It's about happiness and making money. Look at that, Brian. I made 30k in three months being an affiliate. Made 100k in a month for getting on TikTok. Guys. TikTok affiliate. Buying stuff at the dollar store, thrift shops, garage sales, yard sales, antique shops and flipping it on the bay or on TikTok live or on other platforms. This is real stuff. Stan store. Stan store. Go check it. Selling digital product. This is all real. It's all. You're all capable. This is all real. I just sold my first 2K in GMV. Let's go. Julia. You. I'm telling you. Look what's going on? Joey, I'm sad you think that my guy. I wish you nothing but good everybody jobs in my company. You can go to vaynermedia or vfriends jobs. Google that. Check out. Not Stan. Stan S T A N store. Let's ask a couple more questions. Go.
[Speaker B] You mentioned that you feel most like yourself in one on one settings and garage sales based on that. Is there like part of you that you might assume is authentic but actually takes effort for you to sustain other areas?
[Speaker A] Yeah, of course, everything is effort. But I don't think of things in black and white, you know? Justin C says damn, dude aged badly. Justin, I feel. I just want to send you some love. A couple things. Yeah, man, like 40 to 50 is a whole different game, my guy. Two, I don't wash my face with the good stuff. Three, the genetics are crazy. My dad looks like a prune. D. I've always had the raccoon eyes and all that. E. I'm doing nothing good for myself in the lighting. Watch this. I could. I could age better in a second. It's called like use better lighting. Right? Like, like, you know, you know. And then f. Most importantly, I just want to send you some love, Justin. Because the number one thing that sucks in life is spending your time and energy to try to hurt other people's feelings. I might have aged badly, but you're living life badly, which makes me sad. I got love for you, you know, And I'm addressing it here because I need people to understand, you know, somebody whose life is about tearing down others is just in a bad place. And I don't hate them. I feel bad for them. I'm not mad at them. I've got love for them. I'm trying to figure out, like, what can I say to flip it so they can switch to positivity, you know, I'm so grateful that I have so much security in my soul that I'm not asking for the light to get so good. People are just blown away by that light thing. Lighting is crazy, y'. All. Lighting is crazy. But I'm on some, like, I don't give a fuck energy. It's not bad to look better. I mean, I'm not against it, but I'm not about it. And more importantly, it gives me the opportunity to have this real conversation with y', all, which is, don't be like, Justin. And by the way, Justin, I got love for you. Meaning I want to get Justin out of a place where it's his natural reaction to come on and be like, let me say something that hurts. I'm trying to get all of you to come into every interaction with every human being on earth and deploy. You know, I want to say something that's nice because that's it. That's the real game. Someone said, why don't you avoid them? I don't want to avoid it because I want all of you to hear it. Because this isn't about Justin or me. This is for all of you. A lot of you. A lot of you are Justin. You're all talking shit now. But, like, in real life, you say negative things all the time. How many people here. Let's own it. Let's have a real ownable moment. Everybody. How many people here have left a negative comment on somebody else's social to shit on them? Say I have in the chat, Just own it. Be honest. A lot of people are. No way. More people are. I have. And I'm just trying to get everyone that's watching right now that has to understand that there's a better way for them. Well, one person said I did, but they were a Cowboys fan that respect. Probably the only negative interactions I've ever had are with Patriot fans. It's real, you know? So, anyway, I love you all. I'll see you. Have the best day. See you, Sam.
