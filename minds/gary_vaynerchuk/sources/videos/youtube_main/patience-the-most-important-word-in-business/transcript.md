# Patience — The Most Important Word in Business

[Speaker A] So what's the number one thing you wish you knew when you're starting out? So I'm 18. And what is the biggest lesson you learned when you got on the new level?
[Speaker B] Cool, Russ.
[Speaker C] What's the biggest lesson I learned to follow your gut. To always just follow your gut. You know, I'm saying a lot of shit is gonna distract you.
[Speaker B] There's opinions that you may look up to when you first go into it, but you realize they don't know shit.
[Speaker C] Absolutely. Follow your intuition. You know, I'm saying, listen to your gut. It's never wrong, and it knows what the fuck you before you do.
[Speaker B] For me, for me to answer the first part of your question, the one thing I wish I knew when I was starting out is the thing that I preach to you guys all the time. And even though I believed it religiously at the time, even though I was 100 on it, I would have been 110 on it, which is patience. When you're. So when you're. When you're hungry, when you're 18, when you want to be the biggest in the world, when you want to be the biggest in the world, like, it's patience. I'm. I'm 41, right, about to turn 42 in November. So it's not as, you know, I don't know if you play this game, John, is it? John, I don't know if you play this game. When I was 18, John, this is what I would play. I'm like, okay, I'm 18, and in 18 years, I'm gonna be 36. That's young as shit. I have my whole life in front everything I just lived. I have all that time in front of me, and I'm still gonna be 36. And I would do that literally. Literally, even at 30. I remember doing. I'm like, fuck, I've done a lot already. Wine library was already big and everything. I kind of made it a little bit. I was like, and I've got my whole life, and I'm gonna be old but not fucking dead yet. Now I'm 41, and I'm like, okay, I've lived this whole life. Okay, in 41, I'm gonna be 82. I'm like, 82's a little like, you know, like, you know, and so for me, even with that, even with the game that I've played my whole life about doubling up my number to make me realize how much time I still had. So fucking be patient. Do the right thing. Shortcuts kill you. Like, do it Right. Even now, even though that doesn't sound as good. Yeah, I still do it. The fact that you're 18, John, which means you're double your age, you're still five years younger than me. That's fucking insane. And the thing is, you are so quick to be put on to showboat, to win for yourself, for the world, whatever it may look like, it usually leads to the move that keeps you away from winning.
[Speaker A] Awesome.
[Speaker B] The shortcuts.
[Speaker A] I just want to say thank you.
[Speaker B] My pleasure, man.
[Speaker A] Also, I want to say thanks. I've been on you for, like, two years, and you've definitely helped out with my business and everything, so. And, Russ, I've been with you for about a year, so thanks a lot.
[Speaker B] We appreciate, man. Let's get a bunch of calls in because.
