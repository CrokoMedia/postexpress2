Introduction
My	eight-year	old	daughter,	Misha,	wants	to	be	a	YouTuber	when	she	grows
up.	That	probably	comes	as	no	surprise—many	young	kids	find	out	what	their
parents	 do	 and	 decide	 that’s	 their	 ambition,	 too	 (in	 addition	 to	 becoming	 a
firefighter	and	zoo	keeper).	My	daughter	sees	me	using	online	platforms	to	talk
to	people	and	build	businesses,	and	she	knows	how	much	I	love	it.	Of	course	she
thinks	she	wants	to	do	what	I	do.
What	might	be	more	surprising	is	that	if	you	ask	other	school-age	children
what	they	want	to	be	when	they	grow	up,	many	will	reply	that	they,	too,	want	to
be	YouTubers.
Personal	branding	may	not	be	an	elementary	school	Career	Day	staple	yet,	but
kids	today	know	that	making	videos	on	YouTube,	posting	on	Instagram,	tweeting
280	 characters,	 and	 snapping	 on	 Snapchat	 is	 a	 valid	 career	 path	 and	 that	 for
some	 it	 can	 even	bring	 fame	 and	 fortune.	 They	 dream	 of	 creating	 a	 popular
online	 presence	 the	 way	 kids	 used	 to	 dream	 of	 becoming	 Hollywood	stars.
Unfortunately,	unless	they’re	entrepreneurs	themselves	or	deeply	in	the	know,
most	 parents	 will	 respond	 to	 this	 career	aspiration	 with,	 “Huh?”	 or	 worse,
narrow-minded	 cynicism:	 “That’s	 not	 a	 real	 job.”	 Even	 the	 few	 who	 smile
uncomprehendingly	and	 offer	 a	 mild,	 “Great,	 honey!	 Go	 for	 it!”	 will	 likely
secretly	shake	their	heads	at	the	sweet	naïveté	of	youth.
It’s	so	frustrating	to	me.
Obviously	the	first	answers	suck	any	way	you	look	at	them,	but	all	of	these
responses	reveal	a	total	lack	of	understanding	about	what	kind	of	world	we	live
in.	 It’s	 the	 kind	 where	 an	 eleven-year-old	 kid	 and	 his	 dad	 can	 become
millionaires	by	creating	a	YouTube	channel	where	they	share	online	videos	of
themselves	cutting	things	in	half.

I	knew	this	was	the	way	things	were	going	to	go.	For	someone	like	me	with	a
tendency	to	make	over-the-top	pronouncements,	it’s	ironic	that	one	of	the	most
prescient	things	I’ve	ever	uttered	may	also	have	been	the	biggest	understatement
of	my	life:
My	story	is	about	to	become	a	lot	less	unusual.
I	first	made	it	when	Misha	was	just	a	newborn,	in	the	introduction	to	my	first
business	book,	Crush	It!	I	was	recounting	how	I	had	used	the	Internet	to	develop
a	personal	brand	and	grow	my	$4	million	family	business,	Shopper’s	Discount
Liquors,	into	a	$60	million	business.	My	strategy	was	simple	and	outrageous	for
the	time:	I	spoke	directly	to	potential	customers	through	a	bare-bones	video	blog
and	developed	relationships	with	them	on	Twitter	and	Facebook,	inviting	a	direct
one-on-one	engagement	that	had	previously	existed	only	between	merchants	and
customers	 in	 the	 tight-knit	 small	 communities	and	 neighborhoods	 of	 the	 last
century.	By	the	time	I	wrote	the	book	in	2009,	I	had	branched	out	from	my	first
passion—wine	and	sales—to	my	all-encompassing	one—building	businesses.	I
was	traveling	the	world	spreading	the	word	to	anyone	who	would	listen	that	the
platforms	most	companies	and	business	leaders	were	still	labeling	as	pointless
time	wasters—Facebook,	Twitter,	and	YouTube—were	actually	the	future	of	all
business.	 It	 seems	 impossible	 now,	 but	 the	 digital	 revolution	 was	 so	 young	 I
actually	had	to	define	the	platforms.	Back	then,	I	had	to	devote	considerable
time	 to	 explaining	 that	 Facebook	 was	 this	 online	 site	where	 you	 could	 share
articles	 and	 photographs	 and	 your	 feelings	 and	 thoughts,	 and	 Twitter	 was
something	like	it	except	always	public	and	limited	to,	at	the	time,	140	characters.
Personal	branding?	No	one	knew	what	the	hell	I	was	talking	about.	It’s	hard	to
believe	it	now,	but	not	even	a	decade	ago,	the	idea	that	more	than	a	select	few
people	could	realistically	build	a	business	by	using	social	media	was	considered
far-fetched.
I	now	run	a	massive	digital	media	company	with	offices	in	New	York,	Los
Angeles,	 Chattanooga,	 and	 London.	 I’m	 still	 engaging	people	 on	 Twitter,
Facebook,	 Instagram,	 Snapchat,	 and	 any	 other	 platform	 that	 catches	 people’s
attention.	I’m	still	invited	to	speak	all	over	the	world,	but	I	also	reach	millions	of
people	through	my	business	Q&A	YouTube	show,	#AskGaryVee;	my	daily	video
documentary,	DailyVee;	my	role	on	Planet	of	the	Apps—an	 Apple	 reality-TV
show	about	app	development—and	books	like	the	one	you’re	holding	in	your
hand.	I’m	working	more	than	ever.	I’m	having	more	of	an	impact	than	ever.	I’m
happier	than	ever.
And	I	am	anything	but	unusual.
Today	there	are	millions	of	people	just	like	me	who	have	used	the	Internet	to
build	personal	brands,	thriving	businesses,	and	a	life	on	their	own	terms.	Those

who	 are	 truly	 crushing	 it	 have	 grasped	 the	 brass	 ring	 of	 grown-up-hood—
building	a	lucrative	business	around	something	they	love	that	enables	them	to	do
what	they	want	every	day.	But	while	in	2009	that	“something”	might	have	been
homemade	preserves	or	custom	tree	houses,	today	it	could	also	include	being	a
mom,	being	stylish,	or	having	an	unorthodox	world	view.	In	other	words,	you
can	use	your	personal	brand—who	you	are—to	market	your	business,	or	your
personal	brand	can	actually	be	the	business.	Socialites,	celebrity	progeny,	and
reality-TV	stars	have	been	doing	it	for	years.	Now	it’s	everyone	else’s	turn	to
learn	how	to	get	paid	to	do	something	they	were	going	to	do	for	free	anyway.
A	 lot	 has	 changed	 since	 I	 wrote	Crush	 It!,	 but	 surprisingly,	 a	 lot	 hasn’t.
Anyone	who	follows	me	regularly	knows	she	can	fast-forward	through	the	first
ten	minutes	of	my	keynote	speeches,	because	I’m	just	going	to	repeat	the	facts	of
my	life	and	my	opinion	of	the	world	in	pretty	much	the	exact	same	way	that	I
have	been	for	almost	a	decade.	Once	those	ten	minutes	are	up,	though,	you	never
know.	And	that’s	what	I’m	going	to	share	in	this	book—the	part	of	the	keynote
that	 changes	 every	 six	 to	 nine	 months	 because	 that’s	 how	 frequently	the
platforms	evolve.	I	want	you	to	learn	the	most	up-to-date	information	on	how	to
best	leverage	Internet	platforms	to	create	a	powerful,	lasting	personal	brand.
The	biggest	difference	between	my	first	book	and	the	one	you’re	reading	now
is	this:	mine	isn’t	the	only	voice	in	this	one.	I	want	to	introduce	you	to	other
entrepreneurs	who	have	met	with	unbelievable	success	by	following	Crush	It!
principles	to	build	their	personal	brands.	Some	are	internationally	well	known,
some	 are	 still	 climbing	 their	 way	 up.	 All	of	 them	 are	 absolutely	 loving	 life.
Though	each	is	unique,	I	suspect	you’ll	be	relieved	and	thrilled	to	see	that	they
are	not	that	different	from	you.	How	can	I	say	that	when	I	don’t	know	you?
Because	the	secret	to	their	success	(and	mine)	had	nothing	to	do	with	where	they
came	from,	whom	they	knew,	where	they	went	to	school,	or	what	field	they	were
in.	Rather,	it	had	everything	to	do	with	their	appreciation	for	the	platforms	at
their	disposal	and	their	willingness	to	do	whatever	it	took	to	make	these	social-
media	tools	work	to	their	utmost	potential.	And	that,	my	friends,	is	something	I
can	teach	you	to	do,	too.
What	worked	for	me	won’t	work	for	you,	however,	and	vice	versa.	That’s	why
self-awareness	is	so	vital—you	have	to	be	true	to	yourself	at	all	times.	What	I
can	offer	you	is	a	set	of	universal	principles.	We’ll	dissect	every	current	major
platform	so	that	all	of	you,	from	plumbers	(your	pillar	should	be	Facebook;	see
Chapter	 12)	 to	 park	 rangers	 (yours	 is	 YouTube;	 see	Chapter	 11),	 will	 know
exactly	which	platform	to	use	as	your	pillar	content,	and	how	to	use	the	other
platforms	to	amplify	your	personal	brands.	We’ll	dissect	the	social	platforms	that
dominate	the	business	world	today.	I	talked	about	some	of	these	in	Crush	It!,	but

they	have	evolved,	and	there	are	now	even	better	ways	to	navigate	them.	I’ll
offer	theoretical	and	tactical	advice	on	how	to	become	the	biggest	thing	on	old
standbys	like	Twitter,	Facebook,	YouTube,	and	Instagram;	younger	upstarts	like
Musical.ly;	audiocentric	 platforms	 like	 Spotify,	 SoundCloud,	 and	 iTunes;	 and
newcomer	Alexa	Skills.	Those	who	have	been	at	this	for	a	while	will	find	useful
the	 little-known	 nuances,	 innovative	 tips,	 and	 clever	 tweaks	 that	 have	 been
proven	to	enhance	more	common	tried-and-true	strategies.
If	you’ve	been	watching	me	closely	for	years	and	you	think	you	know	it	all,
please	reconsider.	I	talk	to	thousands	of	people	every	year,	and	I	hear	the	same
questions	 over	 and	 over	 again.	 If	 so	 many	 still	 haven’t	 perfected	 their	 game,
there’s	a	good	chance	you	haven’t	either.	Today	could	be	the	day	that	you	finally
“get”	that	little	nugget	of	info	that’s	going	to	help	you	pulverize	whatever	has
been	holding	you	back.	Several	of	the	people	interviewed	for	this	book	said	they
read	Crush	It!	 multiple	 times.	 Entrepreneur	 and	 podcaster	 John	 Lee	 Dumas
revisits	it	yearly.	It’s	only	142	pages	long,	not	so	dense	that	he	couldn’t	figure
out	 the	 gist	 in	 an	 hour	 or	 so,	 and	 yet	 Dumas	 admits	 that	 he	 listened	 to	 the
audiobook	three	times	before	he	finally	understood	what	I	meant	about	personal
branding.	That	eureka	moment	led	him	to	found	Entrepreneurs	on	Fire,	his	daily
podcast	interviewing	the	country’s	most	inspiring	and	innovative	entrepreneurs.
Today	his	show	is	one	of	the	top-ranked	business	podcasts	on	iTunes,	grossing
around	$200,000	per	month.	I	know	this	because	he	posts	his	monthly	financials
on	his	site	and	shares	the	details	about	his	expenditures	in	his	podcast	so	other
entrepreneurs	can	learn	from	his	smart	moves	and	avoid	his	mistakes.	That’s	just
one	example	of	the	kind	of	surprise	and	delight	the	entrepreneurs	in	this	book
regularly	 conjure	up	 to	 distinguish	 their	 personal	 brands	 from	 those	 of	 the
competition	and	earn	hordes	of	adoring,	loyal	fans.
As	always,	I’m	going	to	be	real	with	you:	even	if	you	absorb	every	lesson	and
follow	every	piece	of	advice	in	these	chapters,	most	of	you	reading	this	book
will	 not	 become	 millionaires.	Do	 not	 stop	 reading!	 None	 of	 the	 people
interviewed	for	this	book	knew	they’d	become	rich;	they	became	rich	because
they	were	incredibly,	ridiculously	good	at	what	they	do	and	worked	so	goddamn
hard,	 no	 one	 else	 could	 keep	 up.	 Most	 started	 out	 with	 modest	 ambitions	 of
earning	enough	 to	 enjoy	 the	 good	 things	 in	 life,	 finding	 stability,	 supporting
themselves	and	their	families,	and	living	on	their	own	terms.	Achieve	that	kind
of	wealth,	and	you	won’t	need	riches.	And	who	knows,	maybe	in	the	process	of
getting	there	you,	like	John	Lee	Dumas	and	his	cohorts,	will	discover	that	you	do
have	the	talent	and	marketing	savvy	to	become	a	millionaire.	There’s	only	one
way	to	find	out.	Either	way,	you	win.	It	takes	pressure	and	fire	to	turn	a	lump	of
unremarkable	metal	into	a	finely	crafted	work	of	art.	This	book	is	filled	with

inspiration	and	advice	from	others	who	have	walked	through	those	flames;	let
them	guide	you	so	you	can	see	what	you’re	capable	of	becoming.
Consider	the	experience	of	Louie	Blaka	(IG:	@louieblaka),	who	explained	in
an	e-mail	how	he	went	from	art	teacher	to	thriving	artist	by	trusting	his	instincts
and	putting	his	passions	to	work.
I’m	a	high	school	art	teacher	but	a	fine	artist	at	heart.	Three	years	ago	I	decided	to	give	my	art
career	a	shot	outside	of	my	seven-to-three	teaching	job.	My	artwork	took	off	but	not	as	well	as
I	had	hoped.	I	didn’t	give	up,	but	I	did	become	a	bit	discouraged.	I	listened	to	Crush	It!	two
years	ago,	and	it	helped	me	think	bigger	than	just	selling	paintings.	I	saw	a	trend	of	wine	and
paint	classes	taking	over	the	country.	I	asked	myself	why	I	wasn’t	hosting	these	classes	if	I	had
an	actual	teaching	degree	along	with	the	experience	of	a	professional	artist	(Duh!).	So	I	took
your	advice	of	marketing	through	social	and	held	a	free	wine	and	paint	class	for	my	alma
mater,	Montclair	State.	I	posted	a	picture	of	the	event	on	my	Instagram,	and	I	started	to	get
inquiries	for	booking	classes.	I	started	with	a	class	of	ten	people,	with	maybe	one	class	every
two	or	three	months,	and	I’ve	grown	to	at	least	three	classes	a	month	with	my	next	class
scheduled	to	host	one	hundred	people.	I’ve	spent	zero	dollars	on	marketing,	with	everything
going	through	IG	and	word	of	mouth.	I’ve	been	able	to	market	my	paintings	(as	an	artist)
through	my	wine	and	paint	class	customers.	I’ve	taken	all	the	unused	materials	or	“waste”
from	my	classes	and	used	them	for	my	personal	artwork.
I’ve	been	able	to	grow	my	personal	career	as	an	artist	from	selling	a	painting	for	$200	to
having	a	painting	auction	for	$1,300	at	NYC’s	Coffee	Festival	this	past	September.	I	started
my	wine	and	paint	business	with	a	free	event	with	about	ten	people	at	a	college	campus,	and
I’m	now	hoping	to	reach	$30,000	in	sales	next	year	(I	know	it	isn’t	much,	but	for	a	full-time
teacher	and	artist	it’s	huge).
The	 explosion	 of	 YouTube	 and	 Instagram,	 the	 emergence	 of	 podcasts,	 the
ubiquity	of	platforms	like	Facebook	and	Twitter—all	have	led	us	to	the	tipping
point	I	predicted	nine	years	ago.	You	already	have	the	tools	to	build	the	kind	of
powerful	personal	brand	that	can	change	your	future.	If	you’ve	been	at	this	for	a
while	and	haven’t	gotten	where	you	want	to	go,	this	book	will	explain	why.	If
you’re	a	D-lister	with	your	eyes	on	the	A-list,	I	can	help	you	climb	that	ladder
(and	I	empathize—I	was	on	the	Z-list	for	years	and	know	what	the	view	is	like
from	down	there).	If	you’ve	been	making	excuses,	you’ll	be	exposed,	at	which
point	you	can	decide	to	stop	dicking	around	and	achieve	what	you	set	out	to
achieve—or	admit	that	your	version	of	crushing	it	looks	a	little	different	than
you	originally	thought	it	did.
See,	this	book	is	for	two	audiences.	The	first	is	people	who	know	to	the	depths
of	 their	 souls	 that	 they	 are	 born	 to	 build	something	 great.	 Natural-born
entrepreneurs	should	find	all	the	information	they	need	to	improve	their	current
efforts	or	start	making	plans	of	their	own.	The	second	audience	is	everyone	else
who	 wants	 to	 work.	 Not	 just	 the	 young,	 not	 just	 the	tech-oriented.	 Not	 just
professionals	 in	 established	 careers	 or	 those	 looking	 to	 renew	 themselves

because	they’ve	outgrown	their	industry	or,	worse,	their	industry	is	shrinking.
It’s	in	everyone’s	best	interest	to	build	a	personal	brand,	even	if	they	have	little
interest	 in	 becoming	 rich	 or	 famous.	 You’re	 not	 computer	 savvy?	 Get	 the
computer	or	tech	skills	you	need	to	do	this.	It	is	not	hard,	and	many	of	the	people
we	talked	to	for	this	book	had	as	little	experience	with	computers	as	you	do.	In
case	 you	 haven’t	 noticed,	 no	 job	 is	 particularly	 stable	 anymore.	 Imagine	 the
security	you	would	feel	if	you	had	something	going	on	the	side	that	you	could
blow	 up	 big	 if	 you	 unexpectedly	 had	 nothing	 but	 time	 (meet	 Pat	 Flynn	 in
Chapter	5).	Desperation	can	be	a	great	motivator,	but	it’s	a	lot	less	stressful	if
you	plan	ahead	so	that	you	never	know	the	feeling.
If	you’re	earning	what	you	need	to	live	the	life	you	want	and	loving	every	day
of	it,	you’re	crushing	it.	That’s	all	I	want	for	you.	I	think	of	the	friends	I	grew	up
with	 who	 loved	 video	games	 but	 whose	 parents	 forced	 them	 to	 stop	 playing
because	the	games	were	new	and	scary	and	distracted	them	from	their	studies.
Those	kids	may	have	grown	up	to	make	a	decent	enough	living,	but	by	doing
something	they	tolerate	or	even	hate.	If	only	their	parents	could	have	seen	how
the	world	would	evolve.	Maybe	the	child	who	became	a	lawyer	to	please	his	or
her	parents	could	be	earning	the	same	amount	now	as	an	eSports	(competitive
gaming)	promoter—or	earning	millions	as	a	professional	e-gamer.	Either	way,
that	lawyer	would	be	infinitely	happier.
Parents	 are	 trying	 to	 get	 their	 children	 off	 Pokémon	 Go	 when	 augmented-
reality	gaming	is	going	to	be	huge	for	generations.	They	think	their	daughters
should	make	less	slime	and	do	more	algebra.	Slime	may	be	a	fad;	slime	could
also	become	the	conduit	through	which	a	girl	learns	the	dynamic	of	supply	and
demand	on	Instagram	and	builds	a	million-dollar	personal	brand	and	company.
The	crazy	thing	is	that	she	wouldn’t	be	the	first.	Karina	Garcia	did	it.	She	used	to
be	 a	 waitress;	 now	 she’s	 a	 successful	 YouTube	 star	 famous	 for	 making,	 you
guessed	it,	slime.	How	successful?	With	six-figure	earnings	every	month,	she
was	able	to	retire	her	parents.
1
	In	August	2017	she	took	a	seven-week,	fourteen-
city	tour	to	meet	her	fans.	People	paid	$40.00	to	$99.99	for	VIP	passes.

	Stories
like	that	are	no	longer	uncommon,	and	they	illustrate	why	we	need	to	give	our
children	as	much	freedom	as	possible	to	gravitate	toward	what	they	love	doing.
Because	in	their	world,	nothing	will	be	off-limits	when	it	comes	to	how	you	can
make	a	good	living	and	build	a	stellar	career.	When	I	was	a	kid	making	straight
Ds	and	I	got	caught	reading	baseball	card	catalogs	in	class	so	I’d	know	how
much	to	charge	for	trades,	everyone	said,	“You’re	going	to	be	a	loser.”	Today
they’d	 say,	“You’re	 going	 to	 be	 the	 next	 Zuckerberg.”	 When	 it	 comes	 to
professional	 opportunities,	 this	 is	 the	 best	 time	 to	 be	 alive	 in	the	 history	 of
humankind.	I	don’t	want	anyone	to	waste	it.

If	you	take	away	anything	valuable	or	helpful	from	this	book,	I	hope	you	will
give	a	copy	to	someone	you	care	about	who	is	not	happy	in	his	or	her	current	job
or	career.	If	you	are	a	parent,	please	give	it	to	your	children	as	they	start	to
imagine	what	and	who	they	want	to	be.	I	say	this	not	because	I	want	to	sell	more
books.	Get	it	from	the	library;	I	don’t	care.	I	say	this	because	I	want	everyone	to
know	that	these	opportunities	exist,	so	that	if	someone	is	struggling	or	miserable
or	scared,	they	can	do	something	to	change	that.	If	you	care	about	the	people	in
your	life,	you	want	them	to	be	happy	doing	something	they	love.	Life	is	short;	its
brevity	and	unpredictability	is	the	one	thing	that	scares	me.	It	is	also	long;	a
fifty-year-old	could	still	look	forward	to	another	forty	or	even	fifty	productive
years.	We	owe	it	to	ourselves	and	our	loved	ones	to	be	as	fulfilled	and	thrilled	as
possible	every	day	so	we	are	always	ready	to	share	our	best	selves	with	each
other.	There	is	so	much	in	life	that	is	uncontrollable,	but	our	happiness	doesn’t
have	to	be,	nor	do	our	careers.	We	can	have	all	the	control.	Every	damn	bit	of	it.
The	sooner	we	realize	that,	the	better	off	everyone	will	be.
I	cannot	do	anything	to	make	you	more	creative,	but	I	hope	that	I	can	put	you
in	the	right	frame	of	mind	so	that	when	you’re	ready	to	unleash	that	creativity,
you	will	succeed.	We	are	often	told	we	have	to	make	a	choice—settle	and	do
something	tolerable	to	make	money,	or	follow	our	passion	with	the	expectation
that	we	will	be	poor.	There	are	still	people	out	there	who	believe	that	it’s	a	rare
person	who	loves	his	or	her	job.	That’s	bullshit.	Our	choices	are	infinite	when
we	 understand	 today’s	 digital	environment,	 as	 are	 our	 opportunities.	 We	 just
have	to	find	the	courage	to	reach	out	and	make	them.	You’re	going	to	hear	the
stories	of	people	who	were	scared,	just	like	you.	Who	had	obligations,	just	like
you.	Who	were	told	they	were	being	foolish,	or	 reckless,	 or	 irresponsible,	 or
immature.	They	did	it	anyway	and	reaped	the	rewards.	If	there’s	anything	this
book	 should	teach	 you,	 it’s	 that	 the	 only	 thing	 stopping	 you	 from	 achieving
lasting	career	and	life	happiness	is	you.

The	Path	Is	All	Yours
An	entrepreneur	is	someone	who	finds	a	way.
—Shaun	“Shonduras”	McBride
The	promise	of	my	first	business	book,	Crush	It!,	was	to	teach	entrepreneurs
how	to	monetize	their	passion	by	using	social	media	to	build	a	strong	personal
brand	to	attract	customers	and	advertisers	to	their	websites,	as	well	as	transform
them	into	such	trusted	experts	or	entertainment	figures	that	brands	and	outlets
would	pay	them	to	talk,	consult,	and	attend	events.	In	other	words,	it	was	all
about	building	a	personal	brand	around	your	business	strong	enough	to	make
you	 an	 influencer.	 And	 yet	 the	 word	influencer	 doesn’t	 appear	 once.	 The
multibillion-dollar	influencer	marketing	industry	was	still	so	new	at	the	time,	the
concept	hadn’t	crystallized	when	that	book	was	published	in	2009.	Yet	today,
influencer	 marketing	 is	 poised	 to	 eat	 a	 real	 chunk	 of	 traditional	marketing’s
lunch.	Younger	consumers	spend	increasingly	less	time	on	traditional	media	and
more	time	consuming	content	online.
YouTube’s	daily	viewership	is	closing	in	on	TV’s	1.25	billion	hours	per
day,	as	television	viewership	falls	every	year.
1
One	in	every	five	minutes	spent	on	mobile	is	spent	on	Facebook’s	apps
and	services.
2

Every	minute,	65,900	videos	and	photos	are	posted	on	Instagram.
3
Over	3	billion	snaps	are	created	each	day	on	Snapchat,	where	over	60
percent	of	ads	are	watched	with	the	audio	on.
4
Consequently,	 since	 2009,	 brands	 have	 tripled	 the	 amount	 of	 money	 they
spend	on	social	media.
5
	With	the	explosion	in	the	number	of	social	networks
available	to	anyone	who	wants	to	amass	an	audience,	and	vast	sums	of	money
being	 redirected	 toward	 those	 networks,	 influencer	 marketing	 has	 become	 a
legitimate	 monetization	 strategy	 for	 anyone	building	 an	 online	 profile,	 which
means	pretty	much	anyone	in	business.
How	legitimate?	The	top-grossing	YouTubers	earned	a	combined	$70	million
in	2016.	Many	fit	a	certain	type—several	are	gamer	dudes,	for	example—but
Lilly	 Singh	 is	 a	 rapper-comedian	 who	 features	 Punjabi	 culture	 in	 her	videos,
Rosanna	Pansino	is	a	baker,	and	Tyler	Oakley	is	an	LGBTQ	activist.
6
	In	the	past,
the	 top-grossing	 list	 has	 also	 included	 dancing	 violinist	 Lindsey	 Stirling	 and
makeup	artist	Michelle	Phan.
7
	The	most	popular	Instagrammers	can	earn	seven
figures	per	year	from	their	social-media	efforts	alone.	Even	with	only	a	thousand
followers,	an	entry-level	Instagrammer	could	earn	about	$5,000	per	year	with
just	two	posts	a	week,	and	ten	thousand	followers	could	net	almost	$20,000	per
year.
8
	Again,	that’s	with	just	two	posts	per	week;	imagine	the	earnings	if	that
Instagrammer	posted	more	frequently.	Let’s	think	about	that.	The	median	salary
for	US	employees	is	about	$51,000.
9
	You	can	earn	that	as	an	office	manager,	or
you	 can	 earn	 the	 same	 amount	 running	 your	 own	 business	 built	 around
something	you	love	more	than	anything	else	in	the	world.	Want	to	play	it	safe?
You	can	work	as	an	office	manager,	go	home,	and	then	earn	an	extra	$10,000	a
year	 on	 Twitch	 letting	 people	 watch	 you	 play	 and	 comment	 on	 your	 favorite
video	game,	because	you	really	are	that	good	at	it.	Or	use	YouTube	to	share
insanely	cool	science	 experiments.	 Or	 post	 pictures	 on	 Instagram	 of	 your	pet
hedgehogs	wearing	tiny	hats.	Thanks	to	the	proliferation	of	platforms	and	the
migration	of	TV	and	magazine	viewers	to	the	Internet,	there	is	room	for	many,
many	more	experts	and	personalities	to	create	a	lucrative,	sustainable	ecosystem
that	promotes	and	grows	their	businesses	or	even	side	hustles.
It’s	a	great	time	to	be	a	fashion	model,	for	example.	There	was	a	time	when
there	was	room	for	only	a	handful	of	superstars	to	see	themselves	featured	in
editorial	fashion	spreads	and	on	the	runways.	Then	there	were	maybe	a	thousand
in	the	middle	getting	steady	commercial	work	in	print	and	TV.	The	rest	found
themselves	at	the	bottom,	scraping	by	doing	catalog	and	promotional	work.	But
the	Internet	has	opened	a	floodgate	of	opportunity	for	anyone	willing	to	hustle	to

grow	a	fan	base	through	blogs	and	video	channels	to	attract	the	attention	of	the
hundreds	 of	 thousands	 of	 brands	 eager	 to	 spend	 money	 supporting	 popular,
good-looking,	fashionable	people	by	branded	content	and	advertising.	Not	only
that,	people	blessed	with	model	good	looks—or	even	just	blessed	with	angle	and
filter	savvy—don’t	actually	have	to	model	to	get	paid.	The	huge	shift	in	attention
to	 social	media	 means	 that	 beautiful	 people	 are	 no	 longer	 beholden	 to	 the
magazines	or	talent	agencies	or	anyone,	really,	to	make	money	off	their	looks.
They	can	look	fabulous	every	day	on	their	own	platforms	while	engaging	with	a
steadily	growing	audience,	and	brands	will	come	begging	for	exposure.	Just	ask
Brittany	Xavier	(see	Chapter	13).
We	often	define	an	influencer	as	someone	who	garners	such	a	big	audience	on
social	media	that	brands	offer	to	pay	that	person	to	attend	events,	take	selfies
with	products,	or	talk	about	services.	Brands	have	paid	the	famous	people	of	the
Internet	 billions	of	 dollars	 to	 be	 their	 endorsers,	 sponsors,	 promoters,	 and
product	 placers.	 Product	 placement	 is	 a	 natural	 fit	 with	 the	 YouTube	and
Instagram	 crowd,	 but	 it	 can	 leave	 the	 motorcycle-king	 bloggers	 or	 raspberry-
jam-queen	 podcasters—those	 who	 might	 not	 feel	photogenic	 or	 charismatic
enough	for	constant	selfies	or	video—feeling	as	if	their	options	for	growing	their
influence	and	building	revenue	streams	are	limited	to	selling	ad	space.	I’m	here
to	tell	you,	they	are	not.	You	just	have	to	be	smart	and	strategic	about	how	you
use	your	content.	Look,	I’ve	been	paid	to	write	books	and	speak	on	national	and
international	stages,	and	I’ve	earned	enough	to	make	the	kind	of	investments	that
could	pay	out	for	generations.	However,	I	have	not	made	one	penny	because	an
energy	drink	company	paid	me	to	say,	“This	is	my	secret	to	working	eighteen
hours	a	day.”
I’m	an	entrepreneur	who	built	a	$150	million	media	company	in	part	because
of	my	personal	brand,	which	I	developed	by	first	creating	valuable	content	that
grew	my	influence.	That’s	one	way	to	crush	it.	By	all	means,	though,	go	ahead
and	make	money	over	time	by	running	ads,	for	example	by	selling	ad	space	to	a
candy	bar	company.	As	your	star	rises,	you	could	get	paid	$10,000	for	placing	a
candy	bar	on	your	table	while	you	work.	But	for	God’s	sake,	don’t	stop	there.
That’s	where	you	start.	Don’t	leave	money	on	the	table	because	you	don’t	realize
how	much	bigger	you	can	get.	How	big?	The	Internet	is	an	entrepreneur’s	oyster,
and	you	can	use	its	pearly	platforms	to	build	a	personal	brand	so	powerful	that
the	 world	 is	 not	 only	 willing	 to	 pay	you	 for	 your	 products	 or	 services	 or	 to
promote	other	people’s	products	and	services,	but	also	it	might	even	be	willing
to	pay	you	to	just	be	you.	To	me,	that	is	when	you’ve	become	a	true	influencer.
At	 its	 height,	 influencer	 marketing	 is	 reality	TV	 2.0.	 I	 want	 you	 to	 think	 of
yourself	as	tomorrow’s	newest	star.

You	the	entrepreneur	are	no	different	from	the	organic	mac-and-cheese	brand
that	branches	out	into	cheddar	cheese	crackers	and	chicken	noodle	soup.	The
brand	was	never	about	organic	mac	and	cheese;	it	was	about	organic	comfort
food.	You’re	the	expectant	mom	who	starts	a	pregnancy	podcast	and	then	writes
a	 book	 on	 raising	 kids	 suffering	 from	 anxiety.	 You’re	 the	 home	 cook	 with	a
beautiful	Instagram	stream	who	starts	a	podcast	on	canning	and	gets	invited	to
write	a	column	about	urban	gardening	in	a	national	magazine.	You’re	the	boy
who	started	a	wine	 blog	 that	 wasn’t	 actually	 about	 wine	 but	 about	 making	 a
name	for	himself	as	the	person	who	could	show	other	businesses	better	ways	to
communicate	and	sell.	The	home	cook’s	Instagram	isn’t	about	food	but	about
building	her	influence	in	the	healthy-lifestyle	category.	The	mom’s	podcast	on
pregnancy	is	just	the	patty	of	a	parenthood	burger.
Your	 personal	 brand	 can	 get	 you	 all	 the	 fixings	 you	 want.	 Its	 outsize
importance	in	today’s	business	world	means	stardom	is	no	longer	limited	to	the
most	 beautiful	 or	 telegenic	 among	 us;	 the	 field	 is	 open	 to	 many,	 many	 more
players.	It	also	means	that	most	entrepreneurs	still	have	lots	of	room	to	ratchet
up	 their	 game	 to	 become	 influencers.	 I’m	 watching	 you	 out	 there,	and	 it’s
shocking	to	me	how	many	entrepreneurs	trap	themselves	into	boxes	of	their	own
making,	even	though	they	have	so	much	more	power	than	they	did	before.
Let’s	say	you’re	killing	it	on	Twitter.	What	are	you	going	to	do	the	day	you
realize	you’re	tired	of	Twitter?	What	are	you	going	to	do	if	Twitter	disappears?
What	if	you’re	the	country’s	favorite	beekeeper	and	you	develop	a	deadly	allergy
to	bees?	It’s	 a	 matter	 of	 survival	 to	 think	 beyond	 your	 current	 successes	 and
constantly	look	for	ways	to	create	new	ones	so	that	you’re	never	limited	to	any
one	platform	or	even	one	topic.	How	do	you	do	that?	By	creating	a	personal
brand	so	powerful	that	it	transcends	platforms,	products,	and	even	your	passion.
Take	 cultural	 icon	 Julie	 Andrews,*	 the	 rosy-cheeked	 star	 of	 multiple
Broadway	and	Hollywood	masterpieces	like	Camelot,	The	Sound	of	Music,	and
Mary	Poppins.	Her	entire	career—her	entire	identity—was	built	on	the	soaring
soprano	voice	that	made	her	a	household	name.	“I	thought	.	.	.	my	voice	was
what	 I	 am.”
10
	 Then	 about	 twenty	 years	 ago,	 she	 had	 surgery	 to	 remove
precancerous	cysts	on	her	vocal	cords.	When	she	awoke,	the	cysts	were	gone,
but	so	was	her	voice.	But	because	she	was	Julie	Andrews,	that	wasn’t	the	end	of
her	 career.	 She	 has	 since	 written	 dozens	of	 children’s	 books,	 starred	 in	 the
blockbuster	movie	series	The	Princess	Diaries,	and	most	recently,	in	conjunction
with	Jim	Henson	Company,	produced	and	starred	in	a	Netflix	series	that	teaches
arts	appreciation	to	preschoolers.
Oprah	was	not	just	a	talk	show	host.	Muhammad	Ali	was	not	just	a	boxer.	The

Rock	is	not	just	a	wrestler.	A	strong	personal	brand	is	your	ticket	to	complete
personal	and	professional	freedom.	I	want	you	to	become	the	Julie	Andrews	or
Muhammad	Ali	of	your	industry.	Of	course,	for	this	to	work,	you	have	to	start
with	 phenomenal	 talent.	 Unlike	 these	 celebrities,	 though,	you	 won’t	 need	 an
agent	to	get	you	noticed	by	the	right	people	and	start	making	better	money.	In
2009,	a	comedian	who	amassed	thousands	of	followers	cracking	jokes	on	Twitter
started	making	real	money	only	when	she	got	signed	by	Creative	Artists	Agency
and	landed	a	“real	job”	writing	jokes	for	David	Letterman.	Today,	however,	you
don’t	need	to	write	jokes	for	other	people	when	the	maker	of	M&M’s,	Mars,
could	pay	you	$10,000	to	tweet	your	own	M&M	joke.	And	you	don’t	need	to
sell	 your	 material	to	 a	 television	 network	 to	 land	 a	 lucrative	 deal.	 Let’s
remember	that	back	in	2009,	people	still	used	their	phones	as	phones.	We	were
still	using	flip	cams	to	film	our	videos,	and	our	phones	hadn’t	metamorphosed
into	our	televisions	and	movie	screens.	That’s	all	changed.	The	Internet	became
the	ultimate	middleman,	allowing	every	industry	to	go	direct-to-consumer,	from
music	and	publishing	to	taxis	and	hotels.	Snapchat,	Instagram,	and	Facebook	are
the	NBC,	ABC,	and	CBS	of	our	day.	Your	audience	is	waiting	for	you.	What	you
need	to	do	is	figure	out	how	you’re	going	to	become	the	next	Empire.
In	 2009,	 I	 was	 trying	 to	 get	 you	 to	 understand	 that	 you	 could	 make	 some
money	in	the	online	world	or	use	it	to	catapult	yourself	to	the	mainstream	if	that
was	your	end	goal.	Today,	the	Internet	is	the	mainstream.	You	are	in	complete
control	of	how	the	world	sees	you,	how	often,	and	in	what	context.	Social-media
phenom	John	“The	Fat	Jewish”	Ostrovsky	had	been	on	the	entertainment	circuit
for	years,	signing	with	a	record	label	in	college	and	hosting	a	celebrity	interview
show	on	E!,	but	it	wasn’t	until	he	amassed	half	a	million	followers	on	Instagram
that	he	was	able	to	parlay	his	comedy	and	performance	art	into	a	book	deal,	a
wine	label,	and	appearances	on	reality	TV	(which	led	to	his	gaining	ten	million
followers	 on	 Instagram).	Superstar	 filmmaker	 Casey	 Neistat	 started	 making
online	 films	 as	 far	 back	 as	 2003,	 but	 it	 was	 the	 high-quality	 short	 films	and
creative	daily	vlog	he	posted	on	YouTube	that	cemented	his	personal	brand	in
the	minds	and	hearts	of	eight	million	followers.	With	that	audience,	he	was	able
to	sell	his	company	to	CNN	for	$25	million,	launch	a	new	project	there	that	aims
to	 bridge	“the	 gigantic	 divide”	 between	 his	 young-skewing	 audience	 and	 the
mainstream	news	media,
11
	and	become	the	face	of	a	Samsung	commercial	that
aired	during	the	2017	Oscars.
Personal	Brands	Are	for	Everyone

Strategically	 developing	 a	 personal	 brand	 through	 social	 media	 works
brilliantly	for	creatives,	as	proven	by	the	high	number	of	photographers,	artists,
and	musicians	who	offered	to	share	their	stories	for	this	book	when	I	put	the	call
out	for	submissions.	However,	it	can	work	for	anyone	in	any	industry	who	wants
to	put	in	the	hustle.	You	no	longer	have	to	toil	incognito	behind	someone	else’s
name	or	logo	until	you	build	enough	cred	to	strike	out	on	your	own.	Of	course
you	can,	and	many	do,	often	to	build	up	their	knowledge,	life	experience,	and
savings	accounts	before	taking	that	entrepreneurial	leap.	Several	of	the	people
interviewed	for	this	book	said	that	the	experiences	and	skills	they	gained	in	their
former	jobs—even	the	ones	they	hated—were	essential	to	helping	them	become
the	entrepreneurs	they	are	today.	Take,	for	instance,	Dan	Markham,	who	cohosts
YouTube’s	What’s	Inside?	channel	with	his	son,	Lincoln.
As	a	sales	rep,	oddly	enough,	learning	how	to	convince	doctors	to	use	certain	drugs	taught	me
how	 to	 be	 a	 YouTuber.	 I	 would	practice	 with	 the	 other	 representatives.	 We’d	 practice	 and
practice	and	practice	and	practice.	I’d	never	been	on	camera	before,	but	I	feel	like	the	camera
is	just	like	talking	to	one	of	those	other	drug	reps	or	in	front	of	the	doctor.	And	so,	my	job
actually	helped	me.	I	knew	I	wanted	to	be	an	entrepreneur,	I	knew	I	wanted	to	own	my	own
business.	But	I	was	working	so	hard	going	to	college	and	going	to	my	day	job	and	learning	all
I	could	from	being	a	sales	rep.	And	then	doing	all	the	little	things	on	the	side.	And	failing	and
succeeding.	And	then	finally,	it	just	kind	of	came	together.
I’m	thirty-seven,	and	I’ve	been	working	on	this	since	I	was	nineteen	years	old,	trying	to
develop	myself.	It	took	all	of	those	years	for	it	to	happen.	But	now	I	feel	like	I’m	finally	at	a
place	where	I	wanted	to	be.	It’s	crazy	that	this	is	where	it	is,	but	I	love	it.
Isn’t	it	cool	to	know	there	is	no	prescribed	route?	If	you’re	a	project	manager
who’d	 rather	 be	 a	 beekeeper,	 for	 example,	tomorrow—yes,	 tomorrow—you
could	 launch	 a	 nature-oriented	 podcast	 and	 blog	 with	 perceptive,	 humorous,
creative	 content,	 and	 amplify	 your	 voice	 in	all	 kinds	 of	 arenas	 beyond	 bees.
Then	you	could	start	producing	how-to	videos	or	write	a	book	about	starting	in
the	biz,	ensuring	that	 your	 knowledge	 is	 passed	 on	 to	 the	 new	 generation	 of
beekeepers.	You’d	be	sharing	important	information	and	growing	your	personal
brand	at	the	same	time.	And	then,	you	could	be	asked	to	host	a	special	on	Animal
Planet,	or	National	Geographic	could	call	and	say	they	want	to	do	a	feature.	As
your	personal	brand	grows,	you	might	develop	a	recipe	for	a	new	honey-flavored
candy,	lip	balm,	lozenge,	or	yogurt.	You	might	create	a	new	bug	spray	or	skin
regimen,	or	design	bee-branded	tote	bags	and	gardening	materials.	Or	you	may
get	 a	 direct	 message	 on	 Instagram	 from	 fashion	 model	 Karlie	 Kloss,	 who,	 it
turns	out,	is	super	into	bee	culture,	and	the	tagged	selfie	you	take	together	not
only	boosts	your	book	sales	from	three	hundred	to	thirty	thousand,	but	also	it
sparks	the	next	chapter	of	your	career.	That	shit	is	really	happening.	Use	today’s
social-media	platforms	to	develop	your	brand	and	expand	your	influence,	and

you	can	build	a	business	that	could	continue	to	grow	even	if	you	never	touched
another	hive.
That’s	 just	 a	 hypothetical	 example,	 but	 you’ll	 read	 lots	 of	 real	 ones	 in	 the
following	chapters.	This	book	is	a	celebration	of	all	the	people	who	have	put	the
Crush	It!	principles	to	work	and	seen	massive	success	in	return.	I	want	you	to
learn	from	their	examples.	Some	represented	here	are	my	friends;	many	are	just
random	people	who,	when	given	the	chance,	stepped	up	to	share	with	you	how
they	did	it.	It	was	nearly	impossible	to	choose	from	among	the	inspiring	stories
we	heard,	and	I	wish	we	could	have	featured	everyone	who	reached	out	to	me
and	my	staff.	There	just	wasn’t	room.*	We	heard	great	stories	from	entertainers,
fitness	professionals,	fashion	bloggers,	and	of	course,	marketing	consultants—
people	you	might	expect	to	be	crushing	it	on	social	media—but	we	also	heard
from	a	dentist,	a	financial	planner,	a	dog	trainer,	a	LEGO	convention	planner,
and	 a	 quick-lube	 oil-change	 business	 owner,	 among	 scores	 of	 others.	 Many
started	out	young	and	single,	but	some	already	had	kids	when	they	decided	to
double	down	and	crush	it.	Several	gave	up	lucrative	jobs	to	devote	themselves	to
their	passion.	What	this	should	tell	you	is	that	if	you’re	not	crushing	it,	it’s	not
because	 you’re	 too	 old	 or	 poor	 or	have	 too	 many	 other	 responsibilities.	 It’s
because	 you	 haven’t	 fully	 committed	 to	 making	 the	 leap	 yet.	 You’re	 making
excuses,	like,	“Gary	makes	it	seem	so	easy,	yet	this	is	really	almost	impossible.”
It’s	not,	actually,	but	you	can’t	half-ass	this.	It	will	require	big	risks.	It	will	take
all	your	mental	capacity,	your	time,	and	your	leisure.	You’re	going	to	eat	shit
for	a	long	time,	but	I	promise,	the	sacrifices	will	be	worthwhile.	I	also	promise
that	once	you’ve	developed	a	robust	personal	brand,	you	will	be	able	to	enjoy	as
much	or	as	little	leisure	as	you	want—because	you	will	be	entirely	in	control	of
your	own	life.
Don’t	look	for	a	nine-step	program	to	success	here,	though.	I	can’t	give	you
one.	The	principles	are	universal;	the	path	is	all	yours.	I	will	give	you	examples
of	how	to	use	the	platforms,	as	will	the	people	who	shared	their	stories	with	us.
But	they’re	just	examples,	not	commands.	You	can	do	it	my	way,	or	you	can	do
it	your	way.	Chart	your	path	in	the	spirit	of	Crush	It!,	if	not	by	the	letter.	You	just
have	to	make	the	choice	to	actually	do	it.	I	am	so	tired	of	excuses.	Why	not	try
something	new?	Be	optimistic,	exhibit	patience,	shut	your	mouth,	and	execute.
The	most	exciting	thing	about	the	business	world	we	live	in	is	that	it	is	still	in
its	infancy.	There	is	so	much	room	to	succeed	here.	Unbelievably,	a	lot	of	you
still	 seem	 to	 balk	 at	 experimenting	 with	 new	 up-and-coming	 platforms.	 You
don’t	want	to	waste	your	time	if	it	turns	out	to	be	just	another	fast-fading	trend,
but	 then	 you	 wonder	 why	 influencers	 like	 the	 ones	 you’re	 about	to	 meet	 are
succeeding	 so	 much	 better	 than	 you	 are.	 That	 disconnect	 is	 what	 gives

entrepreneurs	 like	 you	 such	 an	 early	 advantage.	Now	 there	 is	 even	 more
opportunity	to	cash	in	on	your	passion	than	there	was	back	then.	Grab	your	spot,
make	your	mark,	and	start	living	in	the	Crush	It!	universe.

would	appreciate	the	gesture,	but	it	wasn’t	until	she	played	it	at
the	rehearsal	dinner	that	she	realized	the	power	of	the	medium.
The	bride	wasn’t	the	only	one	crying	over	the	video;	the	whole
room	was	moved	to	tears.
“I	got	hooked	immediately.	I	loved	the	idea	of	telling	a	story
and	being	able	to	have	an	emotional	control	over	an	audience.	It
engages	all	the	senses	at	once.”
The	video	Amy	had	made	for	the	wedding	was	burned	onto	a
DVD.	 She	 was	 thrilled,	 however,	 to	 discover	 the	 existence	 of
online	platforms	onto	which	she	could	upload	videos	and	share
them.	She	started	filming	pieces	of	her	life,	taught	herself	how
to	edit,	 and	 displayed	 the	 results	 on	 YouTube.	 The	 process
became	her	creative	outlet.
In	the	meantime,	while	majoring	in	political	science	at	The
Ohio	 State	 University,	 thinking	 she	 might	 want	 to	 go	 to	 law
school,	she	managed	to	get	a	dream	job	at	a	law	firm,	where	she
eventually	 got	 involved	 in	 lobbying,	 fund-raising,	 and	 public
policy.	But	she	also	became	known	as	the	person	who	knew	how
to	edit	videos	and	could	help	you	figure	out	the	privacy	settings
on	your	Facebook	page,	which	would	not	have	been	remarkable
in	Silicon	Valley	but	was	unusual	in	Ohio	at	the	time.	It	was

friends	living	on	the	West	Coast	who	informed	her	that	social-
media	management	was	a	real	job.	And	she	thought,	I	could	get
paid	to	do	this?
That’s	when	the	side	hustle	started.	After	getting	home	from
her	day	job,	sometimes	as	late	as	seven	p.m.,	she’d	buckle	down
to	the	freelance	work.	The	first	small	businesses	she	approached
were	already	overwhelmed	by	all	the	content	they	had	to	create
for	 Facebook	 and	 Twitter,	 and	 now	 here’s	 this	 person	 telling
them	they	had	to	make	videos,	too?	They	didn’t	want	to	hear	it.
Amy	 realized	 that	 the	 only	 way	 she	 was	 going	 to	 get	 small
companies	to	take	her	seriously	was	to	show	them	why	social
mattered.	She	 got	 her	 first	 client,	 a	 local	 sustainable	 food
magazine,	 by	 sending	 an	 e-mail	 explaining	 that	 although	 she
didn’t	have	any	 formal	 social-media	 experience,	 she	 was	 sure
she	 could	 help	 them	 develop	 their	 brand.	Oh,	 and	 she	 was
willing	to	do	it	for	free.	It	didn’t	take	a	lot	of	convincing	for
them	to	take	her	on	as	their	social-media	manager.
She	had	been	working	the	side	job	along	with	her	full-time
job	at	the	law	firm	for	three	or	four	months	when	Lewis	Howes,
also	from	Ohio,	who	was	by	then	making	a	name	for	himself
with	LinkedIn	(see	Chapter	2),	suggested	they	meet.	He	didn’t
find	her	through	the	work	she	was	doing	for	the	sustainable	food
magazine;	he	had	noticed	the	photo	and	video	blogging	she	was
doing	on	YouTube	and	other	social-media	sites,	and	wanted	to
know	more	about	what	she	was	doing.	They	met	over	burgers	in
the	spring	of	2010,	and	he	gave	her	two	pieces	of	advice	if	she
wanted	to	start	getting	paying	clients:
1.	Go	to	Las	Vegas	and	attend	BlogWorld,	the	new-media
conference	where	the	leaders	in	blogging,	podcasting,
and	video	content	creation	gather	to	talk	about	their
craft	and	businesses.
Not	a	problem.	The	magazine	had	already	helped	her
purchase	a	badge.
2.	Read	Crush	It!,	by	Gary	Vaynerchuk.
That	 was	 easy,	 too.	 Amy	 went	 to	 the	 library	 and
picked	up	a	copy.	She	read	it,	and	that’s	when	she	knew
she	wasn’t	going	to	become	a	lawyer	after	all.

I	would	have	been	happy	to	do	this	as	a	side	job	forever.	I	didn’t	know
that	I	could	be	powerful	enough	to	make	this	happen.	Crush	It!	made	me
able	to	envision	what	my	future	could	look	like.	I’d	been	thinking	that	I
first	needed	to	become	a	prestigious	company	to	get	other	businesses	to
hire	me,	and	I	didn’t	give	enough	credit	to	the	fact	that	I	was	already
being	watched,	asked	for	advice,	trusted,	and	considered	a	mini–thought
leader	because	of	the	personal	brand	I’d	developed	through	the	videos
about	my	life.
It	made	me	realize	how	important	personal	branding	is	to	growing	a
business,	and	I	was	already	doing	it	without	even	knowing	it.	So	maybe	I
was	further	ahead	than	I	thought!	Maybe	I	could	turn	this	thing	I	was
doing	 for	 fun	 into	 something	 else	 by	simply	 leveraging	 what	 I	 knew
really	well—how	to	use	video,	how	to	talk	to	a	camera	like	it’s	a	person
—and	then	craft	the	messaging	for	a	very	specific	type	of	person.	It	was
the	only	fire	I	ever	really	needed	to	hit	the	ground	running	because	I
knew	what	to	do	at	that	point.
Now	she	knew	that	social-media	management	wasn’t	going	to
be	her	sector	of	the	online	world.	She	was	going	to	go	after	vlog
and	 personal	 brand	 consulting.	 And	 she	 was	 going	 to	 ask	 for
what	she	was	worth.
Obviously,	the	definition	of	devaluing	yourself	is	working	for	free,	but	I
also	think	I	would	have	stayed	too	low	in	my	pricing	because	of	how
much	it	was	devalued	as	an	industry	in	the	beginning.	Crush	It!	allowed
me	to	wrap	my	mind	around	the	fact	that	my	skill	was	a	major,	major
asset,	both	in	marketing	and	customer	service	for	businesses.	That’s	what
made	 me	 a	 lot	 more	 confident	 in	 my	 pricing	 and	 monetizing	 on	 my
terms.	And	my	confidence,	believing	that	I’m	worth	more,	has	helped
me	get	paid	much	more	over	my	career.	I	just	kept	taking	the	chance,
because	I	knew	I	was	doing	good	work.
She	started	her	vlog,	Savvy	Sexy	Social,	“to	end	the	misery
that	small	businesses	were	going	through.”	By	the	time	she	quit
her	job	in	the	beginning	of	2011,	she	had	gotten	some	paying
clients,	but	the	switch	from	salaried	employee	to	freelancer	was
still	a	huge	risk.	She	moved	in	with	her	boyfriend,	got	rid	of	her
car,	and	did	everything	she	could	to	keep	her	overhead	low.	She
was	prepared	for	it	to	take	months	to	bring	in	new	clients,	but	all
the	work	she’d	done	in	the	wings—getting	people	to	know	and
trust	 her	 by	 talking	 about	 her	 work,	 attending	 BlogWorld,
following	up	with	her	network,	and	being	diligent	with	building
relationships—paid	 off.	 She	 had	 paying	 clients	 within	 a	 few
weeks.	(To	make	sure	she	stood	firm	on	her	prices,	for	a	while
she	created	a	separate	virtual	assistant	e-mail	and	negotiated	for
herself	under	a	different	persona.)

While	continuing	to	teach	on	Savvy	Sexy	Social,	which	has
over	 seventy-five	 thousand	 subscribers	 and	 has	 received	 over
five	million	views,	Amy	has	written	a	best-selling	book,	created
a	series	of	online	courses	on	vlogging	for	business,	and	started	a
second	 successful	 video	 marketing	 business,	 and	 she	 still
presents	keynotes	all	over	the	world.	She’s	newly	married	(hello,
Mrs.	Landino!),	she	has	a	cute	dog,	and	business	is	thriving.	By
any	measure,	she’s	crushing	it,	yet	she’s	reluctant	to	congratulate
herself.
I’ve	had	a	hard	time	fully	appreciating	what	I’ve	accomplished	at	any
point.	 I	 understand	 that	 I	 am	 in	 complete	 control,	 and	that’s	 an
overwhelming	 feeling	 because	 it	 means	 you	 could	 always	 be	 doing
more,	 and	 it	 means	 you	 might	 not	 be	 doing	 enough.	Amazing	 things
happen,	and	then	there’s	a	day	when	I	wake	up	and	it’s	a	bad	day	and	it’s
like,	I’m	failing.	I	never	got	close	to	quitting,	but	there	were	days	when	I
was	thinking,	Are	you	really	cut	out	for	this?	 I	 was	 my	 own	 biggest
challenge.	 I	 didn’t	 take	 the	 time	 to	 be	 grateful	 and	 give	 myself	 the
respect	that	I	had	come	so	far.	It	sounds	fluffy,	but	I	had	to	start	sitting
down	and	reflecting	on	a	weekly,	daily,	monthly	basis	on	what	I	did	well,
and	be	happy	with	that,	and	remember	it	the	next	day,	because	it’s	going
to	be	hard	every	day.	Waking	up	and	knowing	the	challenges	will	come
—and	they	do—I	still	wouldn’t	change	a	thing.	I	know	I	chose	my	right
path,	and	I	love	continuing	to	follow	it	no	matter	what.
Amy	has	a	great	story,	right?	I	love	how	she	scratched	her
own	itch.	I	love	how	she	successfully	channeled	all	her	energy
into	 creating	 an	 incredible	 brand,	 and	 yet	 despite	 having
accomplished	so	much,	continues	to	navigate	and	doesn’t	let	up
for	one	second.	She	is	the	embodiment	of	patience	and	tenacity,
as	are	all	the	other	people	we	interviewed	for	this	book.	I	can’t
wait	for	you	to	meet	them.

What	(Still)	Matters
Before	we	explore	which	platform	you	should	select	to	support	your	pillar	of
content,	I	want	to	remind	you	that	even	a	well-designed	pillar	will	fall	if	it	isn’t
set	 in	 a	 solid	 base.	 What	 usually	 hamstrings	 entrepreneurs	 isn’t	 merely	 the
mistakes	they	make	when	 executing	 their	 vision,	 but	 the	 mistakes	 they	 make
before	 they	 even	 get	 started.	 While	 it	 can	 be	 hard	 to	 pinpoint	 why	some
influencers	build	attractive,	lucrative	personal	brands	that	succeed	beyond	their
wildest	expectations,	it’s	not	hard	to	figure	out	why	so	many	who	attempt	to	do	it
fail.	In	general,	it’s	because	they’re	putting	their	energies	into	the	wrong	things.
They	care,	but	not	enough	about	what	really	matters.	And	what	really	matters	is
a	 pretty	 short	 list:	 intent,	 authenticity,	passion,	 patience,	 speed,	 work,	 and
attention.
Intent
In	business,	the	how	matters,	of	course,	but	the	why	matters	just	as	much.	Maybe
more.	Why	do	you	want	to	be	an	entrepreneur?
To	share	your	knowledge?
To	help	people?
To	build	something	that	leaves	a	legacy?
To	make	a	good	income	to	give	yourself	and	your	family	financial

security	and	breathing	room?
To	have	fun	with	a	creative	outlet?
To	create	community?
All	 of	 these	 are	 great	 reasons	 for	 building	 a	 business	 and	 becoming	 an
influencer.
Notice	what	isn’t	on	the	list?
With	 entrepreneurship	 becoming	 so	 trendy,	 a	 lot	 of	 people	 are	 calling
themselves	 entrepreneurs	 who	 really	 aren’t.	 They	 should	call	 themselves
wantrepreneurs	instead,	and	I	wish	they’d	do	this	before	they	ruin	the	reputation
of	real	entrepreneurs	the	same	way	unscrupulous	brokers	ruined	how	some	feel
about	 real	 estate	 agents	 or	 the	 way	 ambulance	 chasers	 and	 media	 hounds
tarnished	our	opinion	of	lawyers.	(And	I	wish	they’d	rename	themselves	before
they	waste	a	lot	of	time	and	potentially	money).	I	promise	you	that	getting	into
this	game	for	the	gold	is	the	quickest	path	to	long-term	failure.	When	your	intent
is	coming	from	the	wrong	place,	customers	may	still	do	business	with	you	if
they	have	no	other	option	(an	increasingly	rare	situation),	but	they	won’t	tell
others	to.	By	definition,	an	influencer	engenders	positive	word	of	mouth.	If	you
don’t	care	enough	to	induce	others	to	rave	about	you,	all	you’re	doing	is	holding
a	spot	for	someone	who	really	does	care,	the	one	who	will	waltz	in	and	displace
you.
This	 book	 features	 entrepreneurs	 at	 all	 levels	 of	 financial	 success	 and	 all
stages	 of	 influence,	 but	 those	 currently	 at	 the	pinnacle	 of	 both	 share	 three
characteristics:
A	commitment	to	service
A	desire	to	provide	value
A	love	of	teaching
A	number	were	inspired	to	create	their	products	after	unsuccessfully	searching
for	those	products	themselves,	sure	that	if	they	 needed	 them,	 others	 did,	 too.
They	 started	 teaching	 when	 all	 they	 found	 when	 looking	 for	 mentorship	 or
inspiration	were	overpriced	online	courses	that	took	up	their	time	but	didn’t	offer
anything	 truly	 useful.	 When	 creating	 their	 content,	 they	vowed	 to	 take	 the
completely	opposite	approach	by	offering	solid	content	and	real	value.	By	their
own	admission,	most	didn’t	start	out	as	the	most	knowledgeable	in	their	fields,
and	they	certainly	weren’t	the	most	polished.	But	what	they	lacked	in	experience
they	made	up	for	in	earnestness,	honesty,	and	humor.	Every	day	their	podcasts,

photos,	videos,	and	blog	posts	improved,	drawing	their	audiences	back	again	and
again.	They	gave,	gave,	gave,	gave,	and	gave	some	more,	often	for	free.	And
customers	came	back	again	and	again.	Was	it	because	they	liked	getting	stuff	for
free?	Sure,	everyone	does.	But	if	a	product	stinks,	even	free	won’t	make	up	for
your	customers’	disappointment.	In	addition,	a	stinky	product	blows	any	chance
you	might	have	had	to	earn	your	customers’	trust	and	loyalty.	No	one	comes
back	for	products	or	advice	that	doesn’t	work.
Now,	I’m	 the	 least	 naïve	 person	 you’ve	 ever	 met.	 Some	 may	 hate	 me	 for
saying	this,	but	I	don’t	believe	that	most	of	these	people	give	so	much	away
because	 they’re	 so	 goddamn	 selfless.	 They’re	 human,	 which	 means	 that,	 like
everyone	else,	they	have	their	own	selfish	wants	and	needs.	But	I	also	believe
they	are	humans	who	fall	into	the	51	percent.	That	is,	if	your	nature	is	at	least	51
percent	altruistic	and	only	49	percent	selfish,	you	have	a	real	shot	at	breaking
out,	because	the	vast	majority	of	people	are	70	to	99	percent	selfish.	Could	you
use	altruism	as	a	tactic?	Sure,	but	altruism	is	not	the	kind	of	thing	you	can	fake
for	very	long.	All	the	people	I’ve	known	who’ve	tried	have	been	able	to	grow
only	so	big	before	they	were	financially	and/or	emotionally	broke.	I’ll	bet	some
of	the	people	mentioned	in	this	book	started	out	using	altruism	as	a	tactic,	and
they	were	good	at	it	because	it	came	naturally.	Then	they	noticed	that	consumers
react	pretty	strongly	when	they	feel	that	you	give	a	shit	about	them,	which	gave
them	the	incentive	to	play	up	that	side	of	themselves	rather	than	fight	it,	which	is
what	most	of	us	rocked	in	the	cradle	of	capitalism	have	always	been	taught	to
do.	Breaking	the	money-first	rule	is	also	how	I	got	to	where	I	am.	I	have	never
cared	about	the	money.	I	do,	however,	care	deeply,	obsessively,	about	my	legacy.
I	want	the	world	to	mourn	me	when	I	die,	not	just	for	being	a	decent	human
being,	but	for	building	something	tremendous	and	predicting	where	the	future	of
business	 lay.	 And	 then	 I	 want	 to	 fucking	 own	 the	 afterlife.	 Being	 good	 and
generous	and	giving	a	crap	is	the	only	thing	that	will	get	me	either	of	those
goals.	Three	out	of	ten	people	don’t	like	me	the	first	time	they	catch	me	online	or
hear	me	talk	because	they	think	I’m	full	of	shit,	and	that	my	habit	of	giving	so
much	away	for	free,	whether	it’s	time,	advice,	or	mentorship,	is	just	a	gateway	to
making	money.	They	don’t	believe	anyone	really	cares	that	much.	I	do,	though,
which	is	why	the	majority	of	my	haters	eventually	change	their	minds	if	they
give	me	a	fair	hearing.
There	are	a	scary	number	of	people	who	say	they’re	starting	their	business
because	they	want	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	yet	reveal	themselves	as
frauds	 and	 hypocrites	 in	 answering	 one	 or	 two	 direct	 questions	 about	 their
model.	There	are	also	a	scary	number	of	people	who	are	so	cynical	that	they
can’t	 believe	 anyone	 does	 anything	 without	 expecting	 something	 in	 return.	I

acknowledge	the	duality	of	human	nature,	including	my	own.	I	want	to	buy	the
New	York	Jets	(let’s	be	honest;	I’m	addicted	to	the	process	of	trying	to	buy	the
New	York	Jets),	which	means	I	do	what	I	do	so	I	can	make	a	lot	of	money.	At
the	same	time,	I	love	how	it	feels	to	make	a	positive	impact	on	people’s	lives,
which	 means	 I	 do	 what	 I	 do	 so	 I	 can	 help	 other	 entrepreneurs	succeed.
Embracing	these	two	truths	and	combining	them	in	my	daily	actions	is	why	I
win.	It’s	also	why	I	leave	ungodly	amounts	of	money	on	the	table.	For	example,
many	influencers,	including	some	you’ll	meet	here,	sell	online	courses.	Courses
can	 provide	a	 hefty	 revenue	 stream,	 and	 done	 right,	 they	 can	 be	 incredible
resources.	I	choose	not	to	because	I’m	concerned	that,	once	I	put	a	monetary
value	on	what	I	know,	I’ll	feel	obligated	to	reserve	my	best	stuff	for	the	people
willing	 to	 pay.	 It	 would	create	 a	 conflict	 of	 interest	 that	 would	 go	 against
everything	I	want	my	brand	to	be	about.	I	do	publish	books,	but	other	than	an
occasional	 personal	 anecdote,	 there’s	 no	 information	 in	 them	 that	 I	 have	 not
discussed	in	a	public,	free	forum	somewhere	else.	For	anyone	with	the	time	and
inclination	to	do	the	online	digging,	the	information	is	there	for	the	taking,	albeit
sometimes	in	a	less	expansive,	less	detailed	format.	These	books	exist	to	save
people	time	and	to	provide	a	portable	resource	people	can	easily	refer	to.
In	every	decision	I	make,	I	consider	the	balance	I’m	willing	to	strike	between
selfishness	and	selflessness,	with	my	selfish	side	often	getting	short	shrift	in	the
short	term.	I’m	fine	with	waiting	a	few	more	years	than	I	might	otherwise	have
to	 to	buy	 the	 Jets	 if	 it	 means	 I	 get	 to	 live	 with	 a	 clear	 conscience	 and	 the
knowledge	 that	 I	 haven’t	 sacrificed	 my	 legacy.	 You	may	 make	 a	 different
decision.	The	truth	is,	you	don’t	have	to	be	as	altruistic	as	I	am	to	win	big;	in	a
world	where	the	standard	is	pretty	much	nothing,	you	have	to	be	just	altruistic
enough.	But	believe	me,	if	your	every	interaction	and	transaction	is	predicated
on	what	you	think	you’re	going	to	get	out	of	it,	nothing	in	this	book	will	work
for	you.	Consider	yourself	warned.
At	 the	 other	 end	 of	 the	 spectrum,	 it’s	 interesting	 how	 often	 the	 product
actually	 seems	 beside	 the	 point	 to	 many	 of	 the	 successful	entrepreneurs
interviewed	 for	 this	 book.	 Their	 passion	 isn’t	 entirely	 tied	 up	 in	 the	 protein
powder,	the	training	technique,	or	the	beauty	products.	For	many	of	them,	to
borrow	the	words	of	graphic	design	and	branding	instructor	Jenna	Soard	(IG:
@youcanbrand),	founder	of	You	Can	Brand,	their	“truest	love	is	watching	the
‘ahas’	 go	 off	 in	 people’s	 minds.”	 It’s	 in	 seeing	 how	 their	 product	or	 service
makes	others	feel,	in	helping	customers	solve	problems,	achieve	more,	or	feel
better	about	themselves.	In	short,	the	source	of	their	success	lies	in	how	much
they
CARE.

Still	the	best	marketing	strategy	ever.
How	I’m	Crushing	It
Lewis	Howes,	School	of	Greatness
IG:	@LewisHowes
Lewis	Howes	knows	the	sound	of	a	broken	dream.	For	him,	it
was	the	snap	of	his	wrist	as	he	slammed	against	a	wall	during
his	second	game	as	a	professional	arena	football	player.	An	All-
American	football	player	and	decathlete,	Lewis	at	first	refused
to	 accept	 that	 the	 injury	 meant	 he’d	 never	 play	 professional
sports	again.	For	six	months	as	he	recuperated	from	extensive
surgery	in	a	full-arm	cast	on	his	sister’s	couch	in	Ohio,	he	held
out	hope	that	he’d	recover	enough	to	resume	his	athletic	career.
But	 after	 another	 year	 of	 trying	 and	 failing	 to	 rebuild	 the
strength	he’d	once	had	in	his	arm,	he	had	to	accept	that	it	was
over.	For	a	lot	of	people,	it	would	have	felt	like	the	end.	He’d
already	 survived	 childhood	 sexual	 abuse	 and	 been	 bullied	in
school,	 where	 he	 had	 struggled	 to	 keep	 up	 due	 to	 dyslexia.
Sports	had	been	his	refuge	and	his	salvation,	and	he’d	dropped
out	of	college	to	try	out	for	the	NFL.	Now,	despite	all	his	efforts,
he	was	left	with	nothing—no	degree,	no	skills,	and	no	money.
And	it	was	2008,	when	even	people	with	ample	amounts	of	all
three	couldn’t	find	a	job.
What	Lewis	did	have,	thanks	to	his	athletic	training,	was	a
belief	 in	 himself.	 He	 started	 pondering	 the	 question,	 “What
could	I	 create	 if	 I	 could	 create	 anything	 in	 the	 world?”	 He
already	knew	what	it	felt	like	to	get	paid	to	do	something	he
loved,	so	there	was	no	question	of	taking	any	old	corporate	job
he	could	get.	But	he	needed	to	do	something,	because	after	so
many	 months	 of	 living	 on	 her	 couch	 rent	 free,	 his	 sister	 was
getting	impatient.
A	mentor	suggested	he	get	on	LinkedIn.	Lewis	realized	that
the	platform	gave	him	direct	access	to	lots	of	successful	people,
people	who	might	be	able	to	lead	him	to	opportunities	or	at	least

explain	to	him	how	they	had	gotten	to	where	they	were.
“All	I	ever	wanted	to	do	was	be	around	inspiring	people	that	I
could	learn	from.”	He	spent	the	next	year,	eight	hours	or	so	a
day,	 connecting	 with	 local	 business	 leaders,	 inviting	 them	 to
lunch	 and	 conducting	 informational	 interviews	 to	 learn	 more
about	how	they’d	achieved	their	success.	Thinking	he	might	be	a
natural	fit	for	a	job	in	the	sports	world,	he’d	at	first	reached	out
to	a	number	of	sports	executives.	As	one	person	connected	him
to	another	person,	who	then	suggested	he	meet	with	another,	his
circle	 grew	 wider.	 As	 he	 learned	 more	 about	 LinkedIn’s
possibilities,	he	optimized	his	profile,	which	then	led	to	bigger
and	bigger	influencers	agreeing	to	meet	with	him.	By	the	end	of
2009,	he	had	thirty-five	thousand	connections.
At	the	time,	Tweetups—in-person	gatherings	of	Twitter	users
around	a	common	cause—were	a	popular	networking	venue.
“I	went	to	a	couple	and	I	thought,	Hmmm,	I’m	building	this
following	on	LinkedIn.	Why	don’t	I	do	a	LinkedIn	meetup?”	So
he	 did	 one	 in	 St.	 Louis,	 where	 he	 had	 once	 gone	 to	 private
boarding	 school.	 Three	 hundred	 fifty	 people	 attended,	 and
thanks	 to	 selling	 a	 few	 sponsorship	 tables,	 he	 earned	 about	 a
thousand	dollars.
“So	I	was	like,	Hmmm,	why	don’t	I	see	if	I	can	do	another
event	and	charge	five	dollars	at	the	door?”	He	did,	and	he	made
money	off	the	entry	fee	as	well	as	the	sponsorships.
“And	then	I	was	like,	Hmmm,	I’m	building	a	relationship	with
these	venues.	What	if	I	asked	for	a	10	percent	commission	on	the
food	and	bar	sales	from	these	networking	events?”	 They	 said
yes.
In	 short	 order,	 Lewis	 was	 bringing	 in	 a	 couple	 thousand
dollars	a	month,	enough	to	finally	get	off	his	sister’s	couch	and
move	into	his	own	apartment,	the	cheapest	one	he	could	find,	a
little	one-bedroom	for	$495	per	month	in	Columbus,	Ohio.
People	 were	 astounded.	 How	 was	 he	 pulling	 this	 off?	 He
didn’t	have	a	real	job,	he	didn’t	have	a	college	degree,	and	yet
he	was	bringing	big	influencers	together	all	over	the	country	and
being	asked	to	speak	at	conferences.	All	through	LinkedIn.	They
started	asking	if	he	could	show	them	how	to	use	the	platform	for
their	businesses,	too.	And	Lewis	thought,	Hmmm.
Lewis	started	teaching	other	entrepreneurs	and	businesspeople

how	to	optimize	their	profile	and	reach	out	to	potential	clients,
investors,	or	whomever	they	needed.
“I	think	because	I	came	with	energy	and	passion,	I	attracted
opportunities.	 I	 attracted	 people	 to	 come	 to	 these	 events.	 I
became	 passionate	 about	 teaching,	 because	 no	 one	 else	 was
talking	 about	 LinkedIn	 the	 way	 I	 was.	 I	 made	 it	 fun	 when
LinkedIn	is	very	boring	for	a	lot	of	people.”
Not	long	afterward,	he	found	out	that	an	entrepreneur	named
Gary	Vaynerchuk	would	be	having	a	signing	for	his	new	book,
Crush	It!,	in	St.	Louis.	Lewis	reached	out	and	offered	to	help
promote	 the	 event	 on	 LinkedIn.*	 Given	 that	 he	 was	 helping
promote	the	book,	it	made	sense	to	read	it.	It	was	a	long	time
ago,	and	he	remembers	very	few	of	the	details	today,	except	for
one	chapter:	Care.
I	never	felt	like	I	was	smart.	I	never	felt	like	I	had	the	intelligence,	or	the
skills,	or	the	experience,	or	the	credentials.	I	didn’t	have	any	of	that.	So
when	I	read	that	word,	I	thought,	Yes!	I	needed	to	continue	to	deepen	my
level	of	care!	When	I	would	meet	with	these	influencers,	I	would	never
ask	for	advice.	I	would	just	say,	“I’m	so	curious	to	hear	your	story	about
how	 you	 became	 successful.”	 And	 at	 the	 end	 of	 that	 I	 would	 say,
“What’s	the	biggest	challenge	you	have	in	your	business,	or	your	career,
or	your	life	right	now?”	and	listen.	And	they	would	tell	me	everything
they	needed.	I	said,	“You	need	a	sales	guy?	I’ve	got	three	of	the	top	ones
right	here.	You	need	a	programmer?	I’ve	got	this	person.	You	need	a
designer?	 I	 met	 one	 last	 week.	 He	 was	 great.”	 I	 just	 became	 this
connector	to	all	the	most	successful	people.	I	never	asked	for	a	job.	I
never	asked	for	business.	That	one-word	chapter	confirmed	that	when
we	show	up	and	we	add	value	and	we	care,	then	we	can	learn	how	to
make	money	around	it	later.	But	show	up	with	value	first.	That	is	how	I
built	the	last	decade	of	my	life.
Lewis	was	already	teaching	himself	to	be	entrepreneurial	and
making	a	little	money,	but	now,	inspired,	he	really	put	on	the
gas.	Crush	It!	said	you	had	to	be	niche,	so	he	decided	he	wasn’t
going	to	be	“the	social-media	guy”	like	everyone	else	in	2008–
2009;	he	was	going	to	be	the	LinkedIn	guy.	Crush	It!	said	work
fifteen-to-sixteen-hour	 days,	 so	 that’s	 what	 he	 did.	 “I	 was
working	my	ass	off.”	He	built	up	his	expertise	until	every	social-
media	conference	was	booking	him	as	the	LinkedIn	speaker.	He
also	got	creative.
I	started	approaching	venues,	which	were	mostly	restaurants	and	bars,
and	 built	 a	 relationship	 with	 either	 the	 manager	 or	the	 owner.	 I’d	 try

thinking	 about	 how	 I	 could	 make	 my	 event	 valuable	 for	 them.	 How
could	I	care	for	their	biggest	need,	their	biggest	challenges?	So	I	started
asking,	“What	is	the	night	you	make	the	least	amount	of	money?”	And
they	would	answer	“Tuesday	night”	or	“Wednesday	night”	or	whatever	it
was,	and	I’d	say,	“OK.	I’m	going	to	bring	you	five	hundred	people	on
that	night,	because	I	want	to	make	every	night	a	profitable	night	for	you,
not	just	the	weekends.	And	I’m	going	to	bring	new	business	leaders,	a
new	audience	of	quality	people	to	your	business.”
Lewis	 did,	 and	 what	 was	 once	 these	 venues’	 worst	 night
became	their	biggest	night.	From	then	on,	they	were	willing	to
let	Lewis	 host	 events	 any	 time	 he	 asked.	 He	 did,	 but	 he	 also
started	taking	bigger	risks.
“I	just	started	to	go	for	it	and	ask	for	what	I	wanted,	even	if	I
thought	it	wasn’t	going	to	work.	I	started	asking	for	20	percent
commission	 off	 food	 and	 bar,	 as	 opposed	 to	 10	 percent.	 I
charged	twenty	dollars	at	the	door	instead	of	five.	And	I	started
charging	more	for	sponsorships.”
Because	Lewis	was	bringing	so	much	value	to	the	venues,	the
sponsors,	and	the	event	attendees,	all	were	more	than	happy	to
pay	a	higher	price	for	Lewis’s	services.	In	one	year,	he	hosted
twenty	events	around	the	country.
He	branched	out	into	other	service	products,	and	in	two	years,
the	 company	 was	 bringing	 in	 over	 $2.5	 million	 in	 sales.	 But
despite	the	success,	after	a	few	years,	Lewis	was	ready	to	do
something	new.	“I	became	less	passionate.	There’s	only	so	much
I	can	talk	about	how	to	add	the	right	photograph	and	optimize
your	LinkedIn	profile.”	He	sold	his	business	and	got	started	on
his	 next	 project,	 School	 of	 Greatness,	 a	 podcast	 that	 shares
inspiring	stories,	messages,	and	practical	advice	from	some	of
the	biggest	athletes,	celebrities,	and	business	minds	in	the	world.
Since	 its	 inception	 in	 2013,	 School	 of	 Greatness	 has	 been
downloaded	 tens	 of	 millions	 of	 times	 and	 makes	 a	 regular
appearance	in	 the	 iTunes	 podcast	 Top	 50.	 In	 2015,	 Lewis
published	 his	New	 York	 Times	 best	 seller,	The	 School	 of
Greatness.	He	continues	to	coach,	attend	speaking	events,	and
contribute	articles	to	major	media	outlets.	And	while	Lewis	still
loves	and	uses	LinkedIn,	he	has	also	focused	his	efforts	on	other
platforms	that	drive	the	most	traffic,	downloads,	and	sales	and
help	him	continue	to	build	his	audience.	At	this	point,	the	only
thing	holding	him	back	is	that	he’s	just	one	man,	so	he	has	hired

a	stellar	team	to	help	him	run	all	aspects	of	the	business,	from
podcast	editing	to	Facebook	ads	to	customer	support.
“I	feel	like	the	luckiest	guy	in	the	world.	I	had	to	learn	the
skills	 I	 needed	 and	 become	 competent	 enough	 to	 match	 my
confidence,	but	the	thing	that	surprises	me	the	most	is	learning
that	it’s	not	about	how	much	you	know;	it’s	about	how	much
you	 care.	We	 can	 create	 anything	 we	 want	 to	 if	 we	 have	 the
passion,	the	energy,	the	hustle,	and	commitment	to	our	vision.	If
I	 had	 been	a	 jerk	 all	 along	 the	 way	 and	 I	 didn’t	 care	 about
people,	there’s	no	chance	I	would	have	been	able	to	do	this.	If
you	 show	up	 with	 that	 energy	 and	 intensity	 every	 single	 day,
good	things	are	going	to	happen.
Authenticity
Your	intent	will	be	reflected	in	your	authenticity.	You	will	be	a	thousand	times
more	successful	if	you	wake	up	eager	to	share	and	create	something	because	you
believe	the	world	will	enjoy	it	rather	than	because	you	have	calculated	that	this
is	 what	you	 need	 to	 do	 to	 become	 an	 Instagram	 celebrity.	 Authenticity	 is	 a
welcome	relief	to	consumers	who	live	in	a	society	where	they	constantly	feel
that	they’re	being	taken	advantage	of	or	hearing	only	parts	of	the	whole	story.
Don’t	try	to	fake	it.	Eventually	you’ll	be	shown	for	who	you	are.	Instead,	figure
out	how	to	use	the	modern	platforms—Instagram,	Snapchat,	YouTube,	and	all
the	others	we’ll	cover	in	this	book—to	give	away	that	good	stuff	you’ve	got,
whether	it’s	your	incredible	fashion	sense,	your	hilarious	brand	of	comedy,	your
innovative	team-building	strategies,	or	your	stunning	flower-arrangement	ideas.
Figure	out	the	best	platforms	to	showcase	your	true	self,	your	craft,	your	joy,	and
your	love	for	what	you	do.	The	more	authentic	you	are,	the	more	people	will	be
willing	to	forgive	your	inevitable	mistakes	and	stumbles.
I	mentioned	above	that	a	good	chunk	of	my	audience	is	converts,	people	who
thought	I	was	just	a	blowhard	until	they	realized	that	my	message	was	consistent
and	that	I	kept	being	proven	right.	Even	if	people	don’t	like	me,	few	ever	doubt
that	I’m	for	real.	There	are	three	things	working	to	my	advantage	in	this	regard:
number	one,	I	genuinely	don’t	give	a	shit	what	people	think,	which	allows	me
complete	freedom	to	do	and	say	what	I	want;	number	two,	I	care	immensely
what	everyone	thinks	and	will	spend	an	insane	amount	of	time	responding	to

skeptics	who	take	the	time	to	tweet	or	comment	their	criticism,	to	help	them	see
where	I’m	coming	from;	and	number	three,	which	might	be	more	important	than
numbers	 one	 or	 two,	 I	 always	 respect	 my	 audience.	I	 believe	 in	 people’s
intuition,	and	I	believe	that	most	are	very	good	at	sniffing	out	hypocrisy	and
opportunism.	Exploiting	your	consumers	because	you	think	they’re	dumb—for
example,	 selling	 them	 an	 expensive	 online	 course	 that’s	 mostly	 fluff	 and
nonsense—is,	well,	dumb.	You	may	count	on	people’s	ignorance	to	make	a	lot	of
money	in	the	short	term,	but	you	will	be	in	a	mess	of	manure	the	minute	your
customers	find	out	you’re	taking	advantage	of	them.	That	goes	for	corporations
as	well	as	personal	 brands.	 All	 it	 takes	 is	 a	 single	 viral	 video	 of	 a	 customer
getting	 forcibly	 dragged	 off	 a	 plane	 to	 expose	 a	 company’s	crooked	policies.
When	you	disrespect	your	customer,	you’re	one	social-media	post	away	from
having	 your	 whole	 business	 tumble	down	 around	 you.	 I	 have	 no	 interest	 in
taking	that	kind	of	risk,	and	neither	should	you.
How	I’m	Crushing	It
Lauryn	Evarts,	The	Skinny	Confidential
IG:	@theskinnyconfidential
Lauryn	is	the	willowy,	sassy	bombshell	behind	and	in	front	of
the	 lifestyle	 site	 The	 Skinny	 Confidential.	 When	 asked	 to
describe	her	passion,	she	says	it’s	about	building	community	and
bringing	 women	 together.	 But	 she	 also	 chafes	 a	 bit	 at	 the
question.
I	can’t	stand	when	people	are	like	passion,	passion,	passion.	It’s	so	much
more	 than	 passion.	 Execute.	 I	 see	 a	 lot	 of	 people	in	 my	 generation
talking	about	ideas	and	saying	what	they’re	going	to	do.	I	hate	talking
about	 what	 I’m	 going	 to	 do.	 I	 don’t	think	 I	 talked	 about	 The	 Skinny
Confidential	once	for	the	whole	year	I	was	building	it	until	it	was	here.
Because	I	like	to	show.
That’s	probably	why	her	father,	also	an	entrepreneur,	thought
to	give	her	a	copy	of	Crush	It!	for	Christmas	the	year	it	came
out.	At	the	time,	Lauryn	was	still	a	TV	broadcasting	and	theater
major	 at	 San	 Diego	 State.	She	 was	 bartending,	 teaching	 Pure
Barre	and	Pilates,	attending	class,	and	getting	bored	out	of	her

mind.	A	creative,	independent	spirit,	she	felt	that	college	was	a
waste	of	time,	yet	with	no	alternative	in	mind,	she	felt	she	had
no	choice	but	to	do	what	was	expected	and	get	a	degree.	Along
the	 way,	 however,	 she	 had	 noticed	 something	 that	 piqued	 her
interest.	With	Crush	It!	fresh	in	her	head,	an	idea	started	to	form.
There	were	not	a	lot	of	platforms	online	that	were	inspiring	women	to	be
unapologetically	themselves.	There	are	a	lot	of	men	like	Gary	and	Tony
Robbins	and	Tim	Ferriss,	all	these	strong	amazing	men,	and	I	didn’t	see
a	woman	in	that	space.	I	wanted	to	create	one.	And	it	wouldn’t	just	be
about	me,	me,	me	and	the	outfit	I	was	wearing,	but	a	place	where	I	could
bring	models	and	moms	and	everyday	women	together	to	connect	and
share	 their	 secrets.	 I	 wanted	 to	 provide	 value,	 which	 is	 something	 I
definitely	learned	in	Crush	It!
Lauryn	 used	 her	 iPhone	 notes	 and	 a	 binder	 to	 collect	 a
tremendous	 list	 of	 ideas	 for	 content.	 Then,	 although	 she	 was
dead	broke,	she	hired	a	Web	developer,	paying	him	in	ten	fifty-
dollar	installments.	For	a	year,	she	refined	her	craft	and	built	her
credibility,	continuing	to	teach	and	earning	her	license	online	as
a	fitness	and	nutrition	specialist.	“Another	thing	that	Crush	It!
said	that	resonated	for	me	was,	‘Always	put	your	money	back
into	your	business.’	So,	I	was	like,	work,	work,	work	for	tips	and
then	put	it	back	right	into	The	Skinny	Confidential.	And	then
work,	work,	work	for	tips	and	then	right	back	to	The	Skinny
Confidential.	 I	 had	 zero	 dollars	 in	 my	 bank	 account	 for	 the
longest	time.”
When	she	finally	did	launch,	she	kept	her	content	narrowly
tailored	to	health-related	topics.	“Find	that	niche	that	you’re	so
good	at	and	ride	it,	and	ride	it,	and	ride	it	until	you	can	slowly
expand	 out.”	 In	 retrospect,	 she	 might	 have	 been	 able	to	 start
diversifying	 her	 brand	 within	 three	 months,	 but	 her	 brutal
schedule	would	have	made	that	difficult.
I	would	shoot	all	my	photos	from	2:00	to	3:30,	bartend	from	4:00	to
12:00,	come	home,	write	my	blog	post	from	12:00	to	2:00,	wake	 up,
teach	Pure	Barre,	teach	Pilates,	go	to	school,	rinse	and	repeat,	five	days	a
week.	 And	 then	 on	 the	 weekend,	 I	 would	do	 Instagram,	 Twitter,
Facebook,	and	the	e-mails	and	all	the	other	little	stuff	that	comes	with	it.
Slowly,	methodically,	she	started	expanding	the	scope	of	her
brand	into	other	categories:	wellness,	beauty,	home	décor,	and
clothes.	But	she	didn’t	make	a	penny	for	two-and-a-half	years.

“The	 biggest	 mistake	 I	 see	 influencers	 make	 is,	 they’ll	 work
with	every	brand	on	the	planet.	It’s	all	about	how	many	brands
can	 they	 work	 with,	 not	 about	 the	 audience,	 not	 about	 the
readership.	I	 see	 no	 longevity	 there.	 I’m	 more	 focused	 on
building	my	own	brand	than	other	people’s	brands.”
She	finally	monetized	after	being	approached	by	a	brand	that
she	wore	all	the	time	anyway,	and	today	she	earns	“definitely	a
very	 good	 amount,”	 which	 translates	 to	 enough	 to	 provide	 a
comfortable	 life,	 as	 well	 as	 employ	 a	 graphic	 designer,	 an
assistant,	a	 project	 manager,	 an	 editor,	 a	 photographer,	 and	 a
back-end	developer	to	help	her	with	the	day-to-day	operations	of
the	business.	But	she	continues	to	turn	down	brands	every	single
day,	even	offers	of	$10,000	to	$15,000	to	collaborate	for	a	single
blog	post.
Nothing	 was	 off-limits	 on	 The	 Skinny	 Confidential:
“Storytelling	is	so	underrated.”	Lauryn	wrote	about	essential	oils
and	diet	 tips,	 but	 also	 boob	 jobs	 and	 Botox.	 She	 began
introducing	 new	 characters	 from	 her	 life,	 mining	 her
relationships	for	deeper	content	and	fresh	stories	to	share	with
her	 readers.	 Her	 beloved	 grandmother,	 known	 as	 The	 Nanz,
became	a	fixture	on	the	site,	giving	Lauryn	a	way	to	offer	an
unexpected	perspective	on	her	chosen	themes.	She	unveiled	her
boyfriend,	Michael,	when	they	became	engaged;	the	blog	now
has	a	whole	Michael-dedicated	space	called	Him,	and	the	couple
produces	a	podcast	together.
Naturally,	 readers	 were	 privy	 to	 all	 the	 details	 of	 Lauryn’s
engagement	and	wedding.	But	they’ve	also	been	invited	to	share
the	 darker	 moments.	 Lauryn’s	 sad,	 tender	 ode	 to	 The	 Nanz
following	 the	 matriarch’s	 unexpected	 death	 invited	 a	 flood	 of
empathetic	replies.	 When	 jaw	 surgery	 left	 her	 face	 grossly
swollen	for	two	years,	Lauryn,	who	admits	that	until	then	“I	led
with	my	looks,”	showed	the	pictures	and	talked	about	how	the
disfigurement	affected	her	self-esteem.	Readers	raced	to	support
her	when	she	shared	the	story	of	how	she	had	listened,	stunned
and	hurt,	as	two	brand	executives,	unknowingly	still	connected
to	her	by	conference	line,	sneered	at	and	ridiculed	her	following
what	she	thought	had	been	a	promising	phone	call.	The	moment
also	gave	her	a	chance	to	explore	the	hypocrisy	of	brands	who
claimed	to	empower	and	champion	women,	but	only	so	long	as

those	women	fit	a	certain	mold.
I	took	all	my	hurt	and	I	put	it	into	this	blog	post.	And	I	could	not	believe
the	response.	Women	from	all	over	the	world	were	writing	in	with	stories
about	how	they	had	heard	someone	talking	about	them	or	been	bullied	or
put	themselves	out	there	and	been	bashed	for	it.	It	was	really	cool	to	be
able	to	bring	everyone	together	and	lift	each	other	up.
Everyone	says	put	yourself	out	there,	be	your	authentic	self,	but	when
your	authentic	self	is	not	what	they	like,	they	talk	back.	It	was	a	very
weird	experience.	But	instead	of	silencing	me,	I’m	just	going	to	continue
to	put	myself	out	there	even	more.	And	I	hope	that	I	responded	in	a	way
that	can	make	me	a	good	role	model	if	my	readers,	especially	younger
girls,	 ever	find	 themselves	 in	 a	 situation	 like	 that.	 If	 I	 can	 change
someone’s	mind	about	being	catty	.	.	.	if	I	can	use	the	platform	to	call
that	 out	 and	 say	 there’s	 nothing	 cool	 about	 being	 mean,	 whether	 it’s
cyberbullying	 or	 bullying	 or	 talking	 shit	 about	someone,	then	that’s	a
good	goal.
While	it’s	unfortunate	that	she	didn’t	document	that	first	year
when	she	was	gathering	her	ideas	and	strategizing	the	trajectory
of	 her	 business,	 in	 her	 case	 the	 process	 does	 seem	 to	 have
sharpened	her	ideas	so	that	she	wasted	less	time	and	was	able	to
act	more	purposefully	once	she	did	launch.	She	is	an	admirable
model	of	speed	and	patience.
This	is	something	that	I’ve	been	working	on	for	six	years	every	single
day,	seven	days	a	week.	There’s	been	no	day	off.	If	I’m	on	vacation,	I’m
working.	And	I	still	have	so	much	work	to	do.	I	just	did	what	Gary	said
in	Crush	It!,	which	is	constantly	hitting	it	day	after	day,	never	giving	up,
keeping	 my	 blinders	 on,	 focusing	 on	 my	 own	 shit,	 and	 really,	really
doing	me.	Doing	me	to	the	best	of	my	ability.	Crush	It!,	and	his	other
books	too,	allowed	me	to	just	be	who	I	am	and	not	be	sorry	about	it.
Passion
I	know	many	people	working	in	jobs	that	make	them	heaps	of	money	who	aren’t
happy,	but	I	don’t	know	anyone	who	works	around	their	passion	every	day	who
isn’t	loving	life.	As	I	said	earlier,	I	could	take	some	shortcuts	to	make	more
money	and	thus	shorten	the	time	it	takes	for	me	to	meet	my	goal	of	buying	the
Jets—but	I	don’t,	because	those	things	wouldn’t	make	me	happy.	I’d	rather	wait
and	get	there	on	my	own	terms.	We’re	on	this	earth	for	only	a	short	time,	and	the
bulk	of	our	adult	days	are	spent	at	work.	It’s	worth	taking	the	steps	necessary	to

make	sure	those	hours	are	as	rewarding,	productive,	and	enjoyable	as	possible.
Every	one	of	the	people	interviewed	for	this	book	agreed	that	there’s	no	point
in	trying	to	be	an	entrepreneur	without	passion.	Your	business	can’t	be	just	a	job;
it	 has	 to	 be	 a	 calling.	 Andy	 Frisella,	 founder	 of	 nutrition	 and	 fitness	 brands
Supplement	Superstores	and	1
st
	Phorm,	explained	it	best:
You’re	going	to	go	through	a	time	where	you’re	not	going	to	make	any	money.	It’s	not	going
to	be	a	week,	it’s	not	going	to	be	a	month,	it’s	not	going	to	be	one	year.	It’s	going	to	be	years.
And	during	that	time,	if	you	don’t	love	what	you	do,	it’s	going	to	be	very	hard	to	stick	it	out.
That	is	something	that	people	don’t	understand	when	they	hear,	“Follow	your	passion.”	They
hear	rainbows,	unicorns,	bullshit.	But	the	truth	of	it	is	that	it’s	important,	because	if	you	don’t
enjoy	what	you’re	doing,	you’re	going	to	be	that	much	more	likely	to	quit	when	shit’s	hard.
When	you’re	passionate	about	what	you’re	offering	the	world,	whether	it’s	a
sales	training	method	or	vintage	toys,	the	quality	of	both	your	product	and	your
content	will	more	likely	be	what	it	needs	to	be	to	get	noticed,	valued,	and	talked
about.	 Interestingly,	many	 of	 the	 people	 we	 interviewed	 pointed	 out	 that	 you
don’t	even	have	to	be	passionate	about	the	product	or	service	you’re	offering.
What’s	imperative	is	that	you	are	passionate	about	giving.	That’s	what	Shaun
“Shonduras”	McBride	discovered.	Before	developing	his	massively	successful
personal	brand	on	Snapchat,	he	sold	jewelry	online.	The	guy	was	a	skater	and
snowboarder;	he	had	little	interest	in	jewelry	per	se.	But	after	reading	Crush	It!
in	college,	he	decided	to	sell	jewelry	to	test	the	book’s	principles	and	confirm
what	 his	 instincts	 told	 him	 were	 true:	 that	engaging	 with	 customers	 and
involving	them	in	the	development	of	his	brand	would	pay	dividends	no	matter
what	he	sold.	As	you’ll	see	later	in	this	book,	he	was	right.
Finally,	most	entrepreneurs	will	tell	you	that	passion	is	protective,	buoying
you	when	you	threaten	to	become	overwhelmed	by	the	stress	and	frustration	that
is	 a	 natural	 by-product	 of	 entrepreneurialism.	Passion	 is	 your	 backup
generator	when	all	your	other	energy	sources	start	to	sputter.	And	passion
keeps	you	happy.	When	you	love	what	you	do,	it	makes	every	choice	easier.
When	you	decide	to	keep	working	the	nine-to-five	you	hate	because	you	need
the	health	benefits	until	your	business	takes	off,	when	you	agree	to	work	for	less
money	than	you	want	because	the	experience	will	pay	off	later,	when	you	eat
shit—passion	makes	it	all	go	down	easier.
How	I’m	Crushing	It
Brian	Wampler,	Wampler	Pedals

Twitter:	@WamplerPedals
Brian	Wampler’s	parents,	both	commissioned	sales	reps,	were
more	entrepreneurial	than	the	average	mom	and	dad,	but	they
raised	Brian	 to	 follow	 the	 money	 and	 do	 the	 job	 that	 paid,
“regardless	of	whether	you	are	passionate	about	it	or	not.”	So
after	Brian	graduated	high	school	(by	the	skin	of	his	teeth)	he
went	to	work	in	construction.	A	few	years	later,	at	the	age	of
twenty-two,	he	 went	 out	 on	 his	 own	 as	 a	 remodeling
subcontractor.	 It	 wasn’t	 his	 passion,	 but	 it	 was	 better	 than
working	 for	 someone	 else,	better	 being	 a	 relative	 term—he
hated	what	he	was	doing.
His	real	passion	was	guitar,	in	particular	trying	to	make	the
guitar	 sound	 the	 way	 it	 did	 in	 popular	 songs.	 That	 sound	 is
created	through	guitar	pedals,	small	electronic	boxes	guitarists
manipulate	to	create	various	sound	effects	and	tones.	When	a
friend	introduced	Brian	to	an	online	forum	for	people	interested
in	customizing	existing	guitar	pedals,	Brian	dove	in.
For	the	next	few	years,	I	would	work	all	day,	getting	home	about	five
p.m.,	eat	dinner	and	spend	some	time	with	the	family,	then	spend	the	rest
of	 the	 evening	 learning	 all	 about	 electronics	 through	 reading	 and
experimentation.	I	did	this	every	night,	not	stopping	until	three	or	four
a.m.	.	.	.	sometimes	staying	up	all	night	and	then	going	into	work	and
doing	it	all	over	again.
In	 many	 of	 these	 forums,	 many	 of	 the	 questions	 are	 asked	 by
laypersons	who	have	no	experience	in	electronics.	Most	of	the	people
answering	 were	 either	 engineers	 or	 talked	 way	 over	 the	 head	 of	 the
person	asking	the	questions.	When	this	person	asked	for	the	answer	to	be
simplified,	they	were	scoffed	at.	.	.	.	Basically,	there	were	artist	types	of
people	asking	a	question	and	heady	engineering	types	refusing	to	dumb
down	the	answer.	I	was	once	one	of	those	“artist	types”	of	people	in	the
very	beginning.	So,	once	I	figured	everything	out	on	my	own,	I	simply
made	 sure	 to	 explain	 things	 in	 a	 very	 easy-to-understand-and-digest
manner	so	others	could	learn	more	easily.
(Which,	incidentally,	is	exactly	what	I	did	for	wine.)
He	also	started	selling	his	own	modified	guitar	pedals	online.
That	 led	 to	 questions	 from	 customers,	 which	 added	 to	 the
number	of	 hours	 Brian	 spent	 replying	 to	 comments	 and
answering	e-mails	and	even	phone	calls.	He	finally	published	a
series	 of	 e-books	to	 consolidate	 all	 the	 information	 he	 was
disseminating.	Then	he	started	selling	DIY	kits	with	parts	and

instructions	 for	modifying	 particular	 pedals.	 When	 customers
and	retailers	started	asking	him	to	build	and	sell	them	custom
pedals,	he	created	his	own	line,	which	is	how	Wampler	Pedals
was	born.	He	quit	the	construction	industry	and	made	his	living
selling	all	these	products.	Demand	kept	rising.
Brian	 realized	 that	 he	 wasn’t	 going	 to	 be	 able	 to	 keep	 this
pace	 up	 and	 invest	 the	 same	 amount	 of	 time	 in	 all	 of	 his
products.	Something	was	going	to	have	to	take	priority.	It	was
while	trying	to	decide	which	direction	to	pursue,	in	early	2010,
that	he	came	across	Crush	It!	The	lessons	he	took	away	radically
changed	the	way	he	ran	his	business	and	helped	it	grow.
1.	Embrace	Your	DNA:	“I	probably	owe	my	marriage	to
this	idea.	Before	reading	the	book,	my	wife	and	I	were
trying	to	do	everything	at	once—design	new	products,
build	them,	market	them,	find	new	retailers	domestically
and	internationally,	keep	up	with	customer	service,	ship
everything	in	a	timely	manner	.	.	.	manage	employees,
etc.	This	created	a	lot	of	friction	because	I	really	sucked
at	everything	except	designing	new	products,	creating
content,	and	talking	to	new	and	potential	customers.
After	reading	the	book,	she	and	I	decided	to	outsource
everything	to	outside	contractors	or	hire	people	that
brought	in	the	qualities	that	I	did	not	have.”
His	epiphany	 also	 helped	 him	 figure	 out	 which	 side	 of	 the
business	he	should	concentrate	on.
“I	realized	that	I	wasn’t	an	engineer—the	books	I	was	writing
were	 fairly	 complex	 electrical	 engineering	 ideas	 that	 I	 was
simplifying	to	bring	them	to	an	audience	that	wanted	them,	but
my	heart	wasn’t	in	it	as	much	as	it	was	with	creating	something
new,	something	that	inspires	other	artists	to	use	it	as	a	tool	to
make	their	art,	and	creating	something	with	my	name	on	it—
something	that	my	great-grandkids	will	be	able	to	look	back	on
one	 day	 and	say,	 ‘That	 was	 my	 great-grandpa.’	 So,	 I	 stopped
selling	all	of	the	DIY	products	and	focused	on	just	that.”
2.	Storytell:	“At	the	time,	many	of	the	other	companies
were	faceless.	I	simply	started	being	myself	in	an

authentic	way	and	became	the	first	president	of	a
musical	instrument	company	who	did	his	own	product
demos.	This	was	very	odd	at	the	time	to	many	other
companies.	However,	our	customers	loved	it!	They
realized	that	I	was	an	actual	guitar	player	who	happened
to	make	pedals,	rather	than	an	engineer	who	happened
to	dabble	in	a	little	bit	of	guitar.	This	difference,	though
it	may	seem	minor,	was	huge	for	us,	and	a	key	to	our
success.”
3.	Go	Deep,	Not	Wide:	“Analytics	don’t	tell	the	whole
story.	In	a	nutshell,	I	decided	to	stop	chasing	numbers
and	focus	more	on	creating	content	that	brought	more
value	to	our	customers.	A	thousand	views	and	a	hundred
comments	are	much	better	than	ten	thousand	views	and
one	comment.”
4.	Everyone	Needs	to	Become	a	Brand:	“I	insisted	that
everyone	who	worked	for	me	become	a	face	of	the
company	alongside	me.	They	had	to	understand	that
everything	they	posted	online	reflected	the	brand.
Equally	important	to	me,	by	understanding	the	fact	that
everyone	is	basically	a	brand,	they	would	have	an
advantage	over	others	should	they	decide	to	pursue
something	else	outside	of	my	company.”
5.	You	Got	to	Be	You:	“I	jumped	in	with	both	feet,
convinced	that,	if	I	followed	my	passion	with	extreme
vigor,	something,	somewhere	would	happen.	.	.	.	I	just
had	to	be	patient	and	work	harder	than	anyone	else	in
my	niche.”
Patience
It’s	interesting	that	passion	and	patience	go	hand	in	hand.	To	live	in	line	with
your	passion	will	probably	require	that	you	go	slower	than	you	might	want	to.	It
will	definitely	mean	that	you	say	no	more	than	you	say	yes.	Bide	your	time;	you

cheapen	yourself	 when	 you	 make	 deals	 while	 holding	 your	 nose.	 Remember,
you’re	only	crushing	it	if	you’re	living	entirely	on	your	own	terms.
It’s	not	impossible	to	make	bank	when	you	build	a	business	with	the	sole	goal
of	getting	rich,	but	very	often	entrepreneurs	who	get	rich	quickly	sacrifice	their
chances	for	wealth	for	the	long	term.	When	I	was	just	starting	to	grow	my	family
business,	my	friends	who	graduated	college	at	the	same	time	that	I	did	also	went
to	work.	They	started	making	money	and	spending	it	on	trips	to	Vegas	and	hot
girls	and	nice	watches.	Me?	I	was	making	money,	too.	In	the	first	five	or	six
years,	I	grew	that	business	to	$45	million,	and	not	many	years	later,	it	was	a	$60
million	 wine	 empire.	 When	 a	 normal	 twenty-six-year-old	 dude	builds	 a	 $60
million	business,	he	leverages	it	for	twenty-year-old	dude	things.	Yet	I	lived	in	a
one-bedroom	 apartment	 in	Springfield,	 New	 Jersey.	 I	 drove	 a	 Jeep	 Grand
Cherokee.	I	had	no	watches,	no	suits,	and	no	flash.	I	could	have	paid	myself
hundreds	of	thousands	of	dollars	per	year,	but	the	most	I	took	was	$60K.	I	kept
my	head	down	like	an	ox	with	a	plow,	putting	almost	every	dime	I	earned	back
into	the	business	and	focusing	all	my	energy	on	building	a	personal	brand	around
unparalleled	customer	service,	both	in	the	store	and	online.	When	not	talking	to
customers,	I	was	the	most	boring	human	being	on	the	planet.	Today	I	not	only
have	everything	I	ever	wanted	(except	the	Jets),	like	all	the	other	entrepreneurs
in	this	book,	but	also	I’m	having	the	time	of	my	life.	Some	achieved	success	in	a
relatively	short	time;	most	worked	their	asses	off	for	years	before	anyone	knew
who	they	were.
You	have	no	reason	to	start	acting	like	something	special	until	you	actually
have	something	special	to	show	for	it.	Even	then,	don’t	act	special;	the	moment
you	do,	you’ll	start	moving	in	the	opposite	direction.	Take	my	advice:	eat	shit	for
as	long	as	you	have	to.	That	means	be	a	bigger	man	or	woman	than	everyone
around	you.	That	means	the	customer	is	always	right.	That	means	you	put	your
employees	ahead	of	you.	That	means	you	don’t	take	many	vacations,	maybe	for
years,	and	your	only	time	off	is	to	mark	important	holidays	and	to	be	there	for
your	family	(or	your	friends	who	are	like	family).	Be	patient.	Be	methodical.	Pay
off	your	debts.	Unless	your	brand	is	glamorous,	live	simply,	and	even	then	be
practical	and	calculated.	Put	yourself	last.	Once	you’ve	reached	your	brand	and
business	goals,	then	you	can	start	living	it	up	(without	putting	yourself	into	debt,
because	that’s	insane).
How	I’m	Crushing	It

Alex	“Nemo”	Hanse,	Foolies	Limited	Clothing
Company
IG:	@Foolies
The	 day	 after	 Alex	 “Nemo”	 Hanse	 turned	 thirty,	 he	 was	 in
New	Orleans	to	try	to	meet	a	few	women.
Not	just	any	women.	Specifically,	some	of	the	stars	listed	on
his	T-shirt,	like	Taraji	P.	Henson	and	Ava	DuVernay,	who	were
in	 town	 to	 attend	 the	 Essence	 Festival,	 a	 four-day
megacelebration	of	black	culture	in	general	and	black	women	in
particular.	It’s	 the	 T-shirt	 that	 put	 his	 clothing	 brand,	 Foolies
Limited	Clothing	Company,	on	the	map.
But	 what’s	 really	 interesting	 about	 his	 presence	 at	 the
gathering	is	how	he	got	there.
His	fans	and	customers	gave	him	birthday	money	to	pay	for	it.
They	literally	sent	him	the	money	to	buy	himself	a	plane	ticket
so	he	could	attend	and	connect	with	people	who	could	help	him
grow	his	brand.
That’s	 some	 pretty	 spectacular	 customer	 love	 and	 loyalty.
Alex	must	have	been	doing	something	right.
Alex	 has	 always	 had	 a	 strong	 entrepreneurial	 spirit.	 His
mother	died	when	he	was	in	the	fifth	grade,	and	since	he	didn’t
have	a	father	figure,	he	was	taken	in	by	a	family	friend	(who	had
twelve	kids	of	her	own).	He	was	grateful	to	have	a	roof,	but	at
school	he	got	tired	of	getting	picked	on	for	his	raggedy	clothes
and	shoes,	so	he’d	carry	around	a	big	duffel	bag	stuffed	with
chips,	candy	bars,	and	Capri	Suns	that	he	could	sell	to	earn	a
little	money.	He	also	worked	after	school	at	a	car	wash,	where
he	got	paid	under	the	table	because	he	was	underage.	“I	was	just
trying	to	survive.”
In	2005,	when	he	was	a	student	at	the	University	of	Florida,
Alex	 was	 a	 rapper.	 “Dropping	 bars	 and	 spitting	 hot	 lines	 of
fire	.	.	.	at	least,	in	my	mind	I	was.”	While	Googling	“How	to
create	a	brand	for	a	rapper,”	he	found	an	article	that	said	a	rapper
needed	to	create	an	identity	for	his	fans.	So	he	and	his	“brother
of	another	color,”	Billy,	a	big	supporter	of	his	music,	worked	to
come	 up	 with	 some	 kind	 of	 catchphrase.	 “And	 we’re	 sitting
around	 saying,	 ‘Man,	 this	 idea	 sounds	 so	 foolish.	 This	 is	 so

foolish	of	us.’	We	kept	repeating	it	and	playing	around,	and	we
started	saying,	‘Yeah,	we’re	Foolies.’	And	it	was	like,	‘What’s	a
Foolie?’	And	I	said,	‘I	guess	somebody	who’s	dumb	enough	to
try	something	and	figure	it	out	in	the	end.’”
After	 graduating	 in	 2009	 with	 a	 degree	 in	 sports	 medicine,
Alex	couldn’t	find	a	job,	so	he	kept	concentrating	on	his	music
while	working	at	an	AT&T	store.	Then	he	and	Billy	decided	that
rappers	 needed	 a	 clothing	 line.	 They	 had	 no	 money,	 so	 they
ironed	the	word	FOOLIES	on	a	dirty	white	T-shirt.	They	did	what
Alex	calls	the	Daymond	John	effect:	“Put	it	on	one	person,	take
a	picture,	you	take	it	off.	Put	it	on	another	person,	take	a	picture,
take	 it	 off.	 Because	 you	 don’t	 have	 money	 so	 you	 can’t	 give
shirts	to	everyone,	but	if	you	can	post	pictures	on	Facebook	and
Twitter	and	make	it	seem	like	everyone	has	a	shirt,	maybe	other
people	will	want	it,	too.	And	that’s	what	started	happening	for
us,	slowly.”
The	shirts	were	created	to	bring	attention	to	Alex’s	music,	but
they	soon	became	his	main	output.	He	came	up	with	clever	ways
to	deliver	an	extra	special	experience	to	his	customers.	When	he
had	 a	 special	 sale,	 he’d	 send	 customers	 who	 bought	 a	 shirt	a
custom	link	to	a	YouTube	video	of	himself	singing	a	song	with
their	name	in	it,	or	some	other	personal	message.	He	shipped	the
shirts	inside	miniature	paint	cans,	the	idea	being	that	when	you
opened	the	can	you’d	be	releasing	your	dreams.	And	he’d	send	a
handwritten	letter	to	every	customer,	along	with	a	dream	journal,
“because	that’s	the	biggest	thing	that	people	don’t	do:	they	don’t
write	their	goals	down,	so	they	can	never	manifest	and	come	to
life.”
As	 soon	 as	 customers	 received	 their	 order,	 they’d	 post	 a
picture	 to	 social	 media.	 Except,	 interestingly,	 sometimes	 they
didn’t	post	 the	 shirt—they	 posted	 the	 letter,	 the	 can,	 or	 the
dream	 journal.	 They’d	 thank	 Alex,	 saying	 it	 had	 been	 years
since	anyone	had	written	them	a	letter,	and	some	attached	the
letters	to	their	refrigerators	or	bathroom	walls.
The	company	eked	out	an	existence,	barely,	while	Alex	kept
working	a	day	job,	tutored,	mentored	at	Boys	and	Girls	Clubs,
and	couch-surfed.	It	was	hard	going,	but	he	kept	at	it.	Reading
Crush	It!	in	2015	“was	a	confirmation	that	I	wasn’t	crazy.	I’d	go
to	pitch	competitions	and	these	fake	investors	would	chew	me

out:	‘How	is	that	scalable?	Why	are	you	writing	letters	to	every
customer?’	 I	 started	 reading	 the	 book	 and	 thought,	Man,
somebody	finally	gets	me.	It	was	like	finding	a	long-lost	friend
or	meeting	your	twin	after	being	separated	and	you	didn’t	even
know	you	had	one.”
He	realized	his	problem	was	that	he	wasn’t	creating	enough
content.	“I	went	all-out	motivational,	plastering	Facebook	with
posts.”
In	September	2015,	he	watched	on	television	as	Viola	Davis
won	her	first	Emmy.	That	same	night,	Regina	King	won	her	first
Emmy,	 too.	 “I	 was	 bawling.	 My	 brand	 has	 never	 deliberately
focused	on	black	women,	but	they’ve	always	supported	me.	So	I
was	like,	‘Man,	we	need	to	make	something	motivational	based
off	 of	 this	 dopeness	 that	 these	 black	 girls	 are	 doing.’	 That’s
when	we	listed	all	the	phrases,	like	a	regular	graphic.”
The	graphic	was	a	list	of	ways	in	which	people	could	emulate
the	black	female	powerhouses	of	our	era:	WRITE	 LIKE	 SHONDA.
SPEAK	LIKE	VIOLA.	WALK	LIKE	KERRY	[WASHINGTON].	BE	FIERCE	LIKE
TARAJI.	BE	STRONG	LIKE	REGINA.	LEAD	LIKE	AVA.
“I	posted	the	graphic	right	before	work	at	about	eight	thirty	in
the	morning,	and	around	maybe	ten	fifteen,	my	phone	started
buzzing.	 So	 I	 go	 to	 my	 Facebook	 page	 and	 I	 see	 forty-plus
shares.	I	had	gotten	shares	before,	but	this	was	a	weird	number,
and	it	kept	increasing.	What	was	going	on?”
The	 reason	 Alex’s	 phone	 was	 buzzing	 incessantly	 was
because	best-selling	author,	speaker,	and	digital	strategist	Luvvie
Ajayi,	aka	 Awesomely	 Luvvie,	 had	 posted	 the	 graphic	 to	 her
page.	She	messaged	him	and	told	him	he	needed	to	put	those
names	 on	 a	shirt.	 “She	 didn’t	 even	 know	 I	 had	 a	 T-shirt
company.	She	just	thought	I	was	a	random	guy,	which	is	crazy
how	God	works	and	how	everything	just	lines	up.”
Then	Ava	DuVernay	reposted	the	graphic	on	Twitter.
“It	started	freaking	going	everywhere.”	Alex	quickly	added	a
few	more	names	to	the	graphic—LUPITA	[NYONG’O],	UZO	[ADUBA],
ANGELA	[BASSETT],	and	QUEEN	[LATIFAH]—and	turned	it	into	a	T-
shirt	with	the	Foolies	logo	on	the	back.
That	 detail,	 the	 logo	 placement,	 is	 important	 to	 what
happened	next.
A	few	months	later,	on	a	Wednesday,	Alex	got	an	e-mail	from

Essence	asking	for	shirts	for	a	youth	choir	to	use	at	an	event
called	 Black	 Women	 in	 Hollywood.	 They	 needed	 them	 by
Sunday	in	time	to	tape	the	show	later	in	the	week.
“It	was	a	Hail	Mary	mission.”	It	usually	took	weeks	to	get	T-
shirts	printed,	and	on	top	of	that,	he	had	just	switched	printing
companies	because	the	previous	one	kept	blowing	him	off.	The
new	 company	 managed	 to	 give	 him	 a	 quick	 turnaround	 time,
and	he	shipped	the	shirts	in	time	for	the	event.
There	 was	 no	 footage	 when	 the	 event	 itself	 happened,	 but
soon	afterward	he	got	an	Instagram	alert.	It	was	a	picture	of	the
girls	 wearing	 his	 T-shirt,	 and	 standing	 there	 with	 her	 arms
around	them	was	Oprah	Winfrey.
He’d	 had	 no	 idea	 the	 event	 was	 sponsored	 by	 the	 Oprah
Winfrey	Network	(OWN).
He	and	his	COO,	Kim,	started	plastering	the	shirt	everywhere
they	could.	When	the	show	aired	on	OWN,	at	first	there	was	no
sign	of	the	choir.	Alex	was	sure	the	segment	had	been	cut.	Then,
right	after	a	commercial	break,	there	they	were.
The	 T-shirts	 looked	 fantastic,	 but	 Alex	 realized	 that	 maybe
putting	 the	 logo	 on	 the	 back	 instead	 of	 the	 front	 hadn’t	 been
such	 a	 good	 idea.	 “We	 had	 wanted	 the	 shirt	 to	 be	 about	 the
graphic,	 not	 about	 us,	 and	 we	 wanted	 to	 make	 sure	 that	 our
customers	knew	 that	 we	 always	 had	 their	 backs.	 Real	 smart,
genius.”
That	night	Shonda	Rhimes	tweeted	out	a	picture	of	the	shirt,
tagged	to	Foolies,	and	posted	it	to	Instagram,	too.	“I’ve	never
gotten	so	many	notifications	in	my	life,”	says	Alex.
Since	then,	any	money	Alex	has	earned	has	gone	back	into	the
business	or	into	free	shirts	for	influencers.	There	are	a	few	new
versions	of	the	shirt,	listing	different	actors.	He	tries	to	attend	as
many	 conferences	 as	 he	 can	 where	 he	 will	 meet	 other
influencers,	volunteering	to	work	there	because	he	usually	can’t
afford	the	ticket	price.	He	recently	received	a	comped	ticket	to
the	 BlogHer	 conference	 from	 someone	 who	 heard	 him	 speak
about	Foolies	at	another	event	several	months	earlier	and	wanted
to	make	sure	he	could	go.
He’s	committed	to	motivating	people	to	reach	their	goals	with
more	than	just	a	T-shirt.	“I	don’t	want	to	just	sell	you	T-shirts.
What	happens	if	you	don’t	buy	one?	Is	it	now	over	for	you	to	be

motivated?	 Why	 not	 serve	 just	 to	 serve?”	 To	 that	 end,	 he
launched	a	podcast	called	Dream	Without	Limits	Radio,	where
he	 collects	 stories	 of	 dreamers,	 game	 changers,	 and	 people
living	out	their	purpose.
So	 the	 podcast	 numbers	 are	 interesting.	 I	 think	 more	 people	 are
following	me	as	a	whole	than	necessarily	listening	to	the	podcast.	The
episodes	will	fluctuate,	so	we’ll	probably	see	two	or	three	hundred,	or
we’ll	see	fifty,	forty-five.	I’m	OK	with	those	numbers	only	because	the
responses	that	I	get	and	the	people,	they’re	the	fifty	or	two	hundred	who
really	 want	 it.	 It	doesn’t	 sound	 as	 cool	 because	 I	 don’t	 have	 tens	 of
thousands	of	listeners,	but	I	know	those	fifty	or	two	hundred	are	the	ones
who	are	actually	taking	it	and	doing	something	with	it,	and	that’s	what
I’d	rather	have.	Because	they’re	gonna	be	the	ones	who	give	me	two,
three,	four	thousand	later.
I	 get	 to	 bring	 on	 people	 of	 color	 and	 women,	 who	 don’t	 get
highlighted	enough.	You’ll	see	all	these	dope	women	on	there.	I	love
guys,	but	I	know	where	my	market	is,	and	my	niche.	People	tell	me,
“Oh,	you	 need	 to	 expand	 and	 talk	 to	 all	 these	 people,”	and	 I’m	 like,
“Gary	gets	it.”
Alex	mentored	a	lot	of	students	at	the	University	of	Florida
and	continues	to	visit	middle	and	high	schools	to	talk	to	them
about	entrepreneurship	and	getting	out	of	the	’hood.	When	his
brand	started	to	take	off,	a	number	of	his	former	mentees	told
him	 that	 it	 made	 perfect	 sense	 that	 this	 would	 be	 his	 calling.
“This	has	always	been	what	you’ve	been	doing.	Now	it’s	just	in
the	form	of	a	clothing	company.”
Speed
I	 love	 a	 good	 contradiction,	 but	 this	 isn’t	 one.	 Patience	 is	 for	 the	 long	 term;
speed	is	for	the	short	term.	The	pressure	that	builds	between	the	two	produces
the	diamond.
Speed	is	one	of	my	two	or	three	obsessions	in	business.	I	will	always	gravitate
toward	the	thing	that	allows	me	to	live	my	life	more	efficiently	and	do	my	work
faster.	It’s	one	of	the	reasons	I’m	so	excited	about	voice-controlled	assistants	like
Google	 Home	 and	 Amazon	 Echo	 (see	 more	 in	Chapter	 15).	 Entrepreneurs—
heck,	humans!—care	about	time	and	convenience,	and	it’s	just	faster	to	spit	the
toothpaste	out	and	say,	“OK,	Google,	remind	me	to	buy	more	toothpaste,”	than	it
is	to	grab	your	phone	and	type	“toothpaste”	into	your	shopping	list.	If	you’re	just

starting	out,	you’re	going	to	be	slogging	it	alone	for	a	long	time	before	you	can
hire	an	assistant	to	help	you	manage	your	time.	In	the	meantime,	put	whatever
tools	you	can	find	to	good	use	to	keep	you	moving	through	the	day	and	using
your	time	wisely	and	efficiently.
You	need	to	constantly	be	in	do	mode.	I	see	you	out	there	overthinking	your
content	and	agonizing	over	your	decisions,	taking	forever	to	make	up	your	mind.
Your	confidence	is	low,	and	you’re	worried	people	will	call	you	a	loser	if	you
make	the	wrong	call.	Get	over	that	quick.	I	love	losing	because	I	learn	so	much
from	it.	The	reason	I	don’t	talk	about	my	failures	much	is	not	because	I’m	hiding
anything,	but	because	once	I’ve	seen	I’ve	made	a	mistake,	in	my	mind,	it’s	over.
I’ll	admit	it:	I	was	wrong	in	2010;	location-based	chat	app	Yobongo	was	not	the
next	great	startup.	But	what	good	does	it	do	me	to	dwell	on	what	didn’t	work
out?	I’d	rather	look	ahead	to	the	next	thing	that	I’m	sure	will.	My	track	record
speaks	for	itself.	Being	unafraid	of	making	mistakes	makes	everything	easy	for
me.	Not	worrying	about	what	people	think	frees	you	to	do	things,	and	doing
things	allows	you	to	win	or	learn	from	your	loss—which	means	you	win	either
way.	Hear	me	now:	you	are	better	off	being	wrong	ten	times	and	being	right
three	than	you	are	if	you	try	only	three	times	and	always	get	it	right.
How	I’m	Crushing	It
Timothy	Roman,	Imperial	Kitchen	&	Bath
IG:	@imperialkb
Timothy	Roman	got	by	with	a	little	help	from	his	friends.
Once	he	got	rid	of	the	old	ones,	that	is.
Timothy	is	the	son	of	Russian	immigrants	who	brought	him	to
the	United	States	nineteen	years	ago,	when	he	was	eleven.	His
parents	got	busy	doing	what	immigrants	do:	working,	trying	to
get	by,	and	adjusting	to	a	new	country,	a	new	language,	and	a
new	way	of	life.	They	expected	Timothy	to	do	his	part	by	doing
well	in	school	and	getting	into	college.
Problem	 was,	 Timothy	 hated	 school.	 “I	 failed	 everything
miserably.	I	couldn’t	concentrate.	Always,	my	head	was	floating
around.	I	was	always	doodling	some	stuff,	whether	it	was	plans,
or	ideas,	or	dreams,	or	counting	my	profits.	I	don’t	recall	any

formal	education.”
The	profits	Timothy	is	referring	to	were	from	his	dual	revenue
stream.	 See,	 he	 was	 putting	 his	 natural	 entrepreneurial
tendencies	to	use.	By	the	time	he	started	high	school,	he	was	DJ-
ing	and	selling	mixes.	He	was	also	selling	weed.	In	tenth	grade,
when	he	realized	he	was	making	the	same	amount	of	money	as
his	teachers,	he	told	his	mother	he	was	dropping	out	and	getting
his	GED.	She	thought	he	was	dropping	out	to	be	a	DJ,	and	that
was	indeed	the	original	plan;	the	drug	dealing	was	just	supposed
to	be	supplemental	income.	Pretty	soon,	though,	things	reversed,
and	for	about	ten	years,	that	was	Timothy’s	life.
“I	was	in	a	poor	neighborhood.	Nobody	has	the	knowledge	or
anything	to	influence	you	enough	to	say,	‘Hey,	you	know,	you
can	maybe	 try	 to	 do	 something	 legally,	 and	 try	 to	 become	 an
entrepreneur,	and	start	a	small	business,	and	work	really	hard,
and	try	doing	that.’	You	know,	that	wasn’t	even	a	conversation.”
Until	he	finally	wound	up	in	jail	(which	is	how	his	mother
found	out	how	her	son	was	really	making	his	living).
When	he	got	out	a	month	later,	he	was	determined	to	change.
He	 started	 by	 eliminating	 all	 his	 old	 friends	 and	 making	 new
ones.
“One	was	doing	Web	development	and	SEO	[search-engine
optimization].	Another	was	selling	high-end	real	estate.	Another
one	was	 selling	 high-end	 furniture.	 But	 all	 created	 these
situations	themselves	and	were	like-minded.	We	really	clicked
immediately.	They	respected	me,	and	I	couldn’t	wait	to	learn	the
way	it’s	supposed	to	be	done.”
The	 friend	 who	 sold	 real	 estate	 let	 Timothy	 crash	 on	 his
couch.	He	also	introduced	Timothy	to	his	father,	who	owned	a
construction	company,	who	then	offered	Timothy	a	position.	At
the	 same	 time,	 Timothy,	 who	 thought	 he	 might	 like	 to	 be	 a
website	designer,	was	spending	a	lot	of	time	trying	to	educate
himself	 via	 YouTube.	 That’s	 how	 he	 somehow	 came	 across	 a
Gary	Vee	video.	“I	find	out	that	he’s	Russian	and	that	his	parents
are	immigrants,	and	immediately	there’s	this	crazy	connection
and	I	really	get	sucked	in.	I	got	hooked.”	He	plowed	through	all
the	video	material	he	could	find,	and	when	he	realized	the	only
other	 way	to	 get	 more	 information	 was	 through	Crush	It!,	 he
read	that,	too,	even	though	reading	was	so	difficult	for	him	that

he’d	read	only	one	book	(Tony	Hsieh’s	Delivering	Happiness)	in
his	life	until	that	point.
I’d	never	had	a	sounding	board,	no	one	to	say,	“Hey,	you	know,	you	can
do	this.	Go	out	there;	get	it	done.”	The	message	from	Crush	It!	was,	no
matter	where	you	are,	who	you	are,	color	of	your	skin,	where	you’re
from,	size,	shape,	and	all	that	good	stuff,	if	you	really	feel	like	you’re
good	at	something,	if	you	put	in	the	work,	I	guarantee	you,	you	will	get
somewhere.	You	know,	it’s	hard	to	get	your	mind	around	it	when	you
have	no	experience	with	that,	but	I	kinda	just	took	it	and	ran	with	it.
That	 was	 the	 end	 of	 2012.	 Within	 six	 to	 eight	 months	 of
working	 with	 his	 friend’s	 father,	 Timothy	 was	 sure	 that	 he
wanted	to	start	his	own	company,	a	kitchen	and	bath	specialty
contractor.	In	two-and-a-half	years,	he	went	from	pushing	paper
to	closing	projects,	becoming	the	owner’s	right-hand	man.	That
was	 just	 during	 the	 day.	 After	 work,	 until	 two	 or	 three	 a.m.,
Timothy	studied.
I	would	learn	everything	I	possibly	could	about	the	construction	industry,
read	 magazines,	 learn	 architects’	 names.	 I	 wanted	to	 have	 so	 much
information	on	day	one	of	my	business	that	if	I	had	a	conversation	with	a
client,	I	could	deliver	so	much	value.	I	was	trying	to	learn	so	much	about
the	product	that	people	would	not	look	at	my	age	and	lack	of	experience
as	a	weak	point	but	overlook	that	when	I	told	them	everything	that	I
know.
I	was	computer	savvy	and	had	some	basic	skills,	so	I	would	work	on
the	website.	I	would	try	to	write	content.	Contractors	didn’t	have	proper
marketing	 materials.	 Forget	 about	 SEO.	 The	 ones	 who	 had	 websites
were	really	big	companies	with	ten	trucks.	Your	regular	kitchen-and-bath
guys	 were	 all	 in	 their	 forties,	 fifties,	 and	 sixties	 and	 have	 been	 in
business	 for	 twenty	 or	thirty	 years.	 They’ve	 established	 so	 many
relationships	 that	 some	 are	 doing	 business	 literally	 through	 word	 of
mouth.	I	knew	that	it	would	take	me	years	to	establish	word	of	mouth	the
traditional	 way.	 I	 was	 doing	 things	 that	 other	 contractors	 didn’t	even
understand,	and	it	was	very	time-consuming.	We	didn’t	have	all	the	apps
that	we	have	today	that	can	automate	it	for	you.
Through	 his	 work,	 he’d	 developed	 relationships	 with
subcontractors,	and	with	his	boss’s	blessing,	he	spent	all	his	time
outside	of	his	day	job	planting	the	seeds	for	his	own	company
through	Facebook	and	YouTube.	Little	by	little,	people	started	to
engage	with	 his	 content.	 If	 someone	 liked	 a	 picture,	 Timothy
sent	a	thank-you	message.	If	someone	e-mailed	for	an	estimate
and	he	was	able	to	get	an	address,	that	person	got	a	thank-you
note	 and	 small	 gifts	 around	 the	 holidays.	 He	 landed	 his	 first

projects	by	the	middle	of	2015.	Fortunately,	he	didn’t	have	to	be
at	work	until	9:30	a.m.,	which	gave	him	several	hours	to	focus
on	his	own	projects	before	his	day	had	even	officially	started.
This	meant	that	by	lunchtime,	he	could	just	run	out	to	check	on
his	subcontractors’	work,	leaving	his	evenings	free	for	e-mails
and	sales	work.
Once	he	had	three	projects	lined	up,	he	informed	his	boss	he
was	ready	to	quit.	His	schedule	didn’t	ease	up,	though.	He	just
filled	those	hours	with	more	work,	more	engagement,	and	more
content	creation.	He	uses	Snapchat	Stories	and	Instagram	Stories
to	share	behind-the-scenes	peeks	at	projects,	and	now	that	he	has
a	showroom,	he	can	easily	introduce	new	products	when	they
come	in.
Two	 years	 after	 going	 out	 on	 his	 own,	 Timothy’s	 company
crossed	 the	 million-dollar	 sales	 mark,	 with	 projections	 to	 hit
$2.5M	to	3.0M	by	the	end	of	2017.
“You	know,	I	make	sacrifices	and	crazy	decisions	every	day,
knowing	 that	 it’s	 all	 going	 to	 work	 out.	 Now	 it	 just	 becomes
routine.	Owning	your	own	business	sounds	really,	really	scary,
and	it’s	a	lot	of	responsibility.	But	Gary	was	like,	‘What’s	the
worst	that	could	happen?	Go	for	it.	The	market	will	tell	you	if
you’ve	got	it	or	not.’”
Incidentally,	 Timothy’s	 mother	 is	 incredibly	 proud.	 “My
mother	 is	 in	 tears	 every	 time	 I	 tell	 her	 about	 some	 new
accomplishment,	or	project	that	I’ve	done,	or	a	milestone	I’ve
crossed.	It’s	just	been,	you	know,	really	great.”
Work
I’ve	audited	a	lot	of	people	over	the	years	who	on	the	surface	seemed	to	be	doing
everything	 right.	 They’d	 established	 a	 good	niche,	 they	 were	 personable	 and
interesting,	 their	 content	 was	 on	 target	 and	 valuable,	 yet	 they	 expressed
frustration	that	they	weren’t	meeting	their	business	goals.	When	I	looked	closer,
I’d	see	that	they	were	still	playing	golf	or	tweeting	about	the	previous	night’s
Walking	Dead	episode.	Let	me	make	this	as	clear	as	I	can:
When	you	first	start	out,	there	is	no	time	for	leisure—if	you	want	to	crush

it.	There	is	no	time	for	YouTube	videos	or	shooting	the	shit	in	the	breakroom	or
an	hour-and-a-half	lunch.	That	is,	of	course,	why	entrepreneurship	is	often	seen
as	a	young	person’s	game.	It	takes	a	lot	of	stamina	to	get	a	personal	brand	and
business	 off	 the	 ground.	 It	is	 a	 lot	 easier	 to	 devote	 all	 your	 time	 to	 a	 new
business	endeavor	when	you’re	twenty-five	and	single	with	no	one	to	answer	to
but	yourself.	Still,	95	percent	of	the	people	reading	this	book,	even	the	young
ones,	probably	have	some	kind	of	obligation:	college	loans	(many	are	likely	still
in	 school),	 mortgages,	 child	 support,	 elderly	 parents,	 or	 dependent	 families.
Most	probably	already	have	a	job.	Maybe	you’ve	got	a	flexible	schedule	because
you’re	driving	for	a	rideshare	company	or	working	part-time	or	nights.	But	most
of	you	are	working	nine	to	five	or	even	eight	to	six.	Your	only	prayer	to	one	day
live	the	Crush	It!	life,	therefore,	is	to	deploy	ungodly	amounts	of	work	from
seven	 p.m.	 to	 two	 a.m.	 Monday	 through	 Friday,	 plus	 all	 day	 Saturdays	and
Sundays.	Ideally	you’ll	be	building	your	business	around	the	thing	you	love	to
do	for	fun	and	relaxation,	so	it	won’t	feel	like	losing	your	leisure	time.	The	only
additional	thing	you	will	have	time	for	is	your	family.	They	deserve	to	get	the
best	of	you,	so	make	sure	you	don’t	let	the	work	creep	in	to	all	of	your	time	with
them—unless	you	can	make	them	part	of	it,	which	would	be	wonderful.	Bring
them	in	on	this	adventure	with	you!	Many	people	interviewed	for	this	book	have
done	this.	Rodrigo	Tasca	hired	his	sister	to	help	him	build	his	video	production
business,	and	they	worked	out	of	his	bedroom	in	their	parents’	house.	Jared	Polin
and	 Lauryn	 Evarts	 both	 regularly	 featured	 their	 grandmothers	 on	 their	 blogs.
Rich	Roll’s	children	and	his	wife,	Julie,	are	a	constant	presence	in	his	videos	and
photographs,	 and	 the	 couple	 are	 listed	 as	 coauthors	 on	 their	first	 cookbook.
When	 Brittany	 Xavier	 books	 a	 mother-daughter	 Mother’s	 Day	 branding
opportunity	or	photo	shoot,	she	puts	a	portion	of	the	fee	in	an	account	set	aside
for	her	daughter,	because	without	her	child,	these	opportunities	wouldn’t	exist.
Since	she	turned	nine,	Chad	Collins’s	daughter	Jordyn	has	run	the	trivia	events
conducted	at	Brick	Fest	Live,	the	nationwide	LEGO	event	that	grew	out	of	the
LEGO	YouTube	channel	they	built	together.	This	is	what	the	modern-day	family
business	can	look	like.*
You	have	to	decide	how	you’re	going	to	spend	your	time.	Start	by	blocking
off	the	hours	you	must	spend	on	your	obligations—your	job,	your	kids,	your
spouse,	your	aging	mother.	If	you’re	serious	about	crushing	it,	every	minute	not
spent	 on	 those	 obligations	should	 be	 spent	 producing	 content,	 distributing
content,	engaging	with	your	community,	or	engaging	in	business	development.
Stephen	Marinaro	(IG:	@TheSalonGuy),	who	was	a	hairstylist,	a	DJ,	a	fireman,
and	a	fugitive	recovery	agent	before	becoming	YouTube’s	TheSalonGuy,	one	of
the	largest	professional	hair	channels	on	the	platform,	was	relentless	in	his	quest

to	build	his	brand.	“If	you	sit	on	your	butt	all	day	waiting	for	things	to	come	to
you,	nothing	is	going	to	happen.”	Once	just	a	vlogger	who	might	film	himself
demonstrating	haircutting	techniques,	his	dogged	persistence	led	him	to	being
featured	on	reality-TV	episodes,	making	appearances	on	Good	Morning	America
and	Fox	 News,	 covering	 the	 Oscars,	 and	 becoming	 a	 fixture	 at	 New	 York
Fashion	Week	events,	where	he	interviewed	celebrities	and	designers.	He	went
from	earning	a	total	of	$20K	four	years	ago	to	being	able	to	charge	thousands	of
dollars	per	month	to	offer	media	services	to	brands.
Do	things!	Create	content	daily.	Biz-dev	daily.	Meet	with	two	or	three	people
per	day	who	can	get	you	awareness,	distribution,	or	sales—somehow	closer	to
your	goals.	DM	people	on	Instagram	with	offers	to	collaborate	(instructions	in
Chapter	13).	You	should	be	taking	these	actions	twelve,	fifteen	hours	per	day.	If
you’re	working	another	job,	you	should	be	cramming	as	much	work	as	you	can
in	the	three	or	four	hours	you	have	to	yourself	per	night	(or	day,	if	you	work	the
night	shift).	And	don’t	forget	to	sleep.	Six	to	eight	hours	of	sleep	per	day	or
night	is	ideal	for	most	people.	Just	make	every	minute	of	your	remaining	sixteen
to	eighteen	hours	count.
Do	 you	 think	 this	 kind	 of	 relentless	 work	 ethic	 sounds	 unhealthy?	 Does	 it
sound	like	too	much?	Pay	attention	to	those	feelings.	Self-awareness	is	vitally
important.
Crushing	 it	 is	 about	 living	 on	 your	 own	 terms,	 equally	 satisfied	 with	 your
income	 and	 your	 life.	 You	 will	 get	 no	 judgment	from	 me	 if	 your	 goals	 are
modest.	I	have	obnoxious	ambition,	but	I	don’t	think	everyone	else	should,	and	I
don’t	want	anyone	to	think	I’ve	got	a	mold	and	expect	everyone	who	reads	this
to	force	themselves	to	fit	into	it.	But	please,	if	you’re	not	willing	to	do	the	grind,
for	God’s	sake	do	not	complain	when	your	business	doesn’t	grow	as	fast	or	as
big	as	you	want	it	to.	Maybe	you	decide	to	spend	two	hours	a	week	volunteering
at	the	animal	shelter	or	the	food	bank,	or	maybe	you	decide	to	join	a	cycling
club.	You	go	to	the	movies.	You	play	mobile	games	during	your	flights.	That’s
fine!	It	probably	makes	you	a	better	person.	But	then	accept	that	your	ambitions
are	 humbler	 than	 you	 originally	 thought	 and	 be	 good	 with	 it.	 Not	 everyone
should	try	to	build	a	business	as	big	as	it	can	get.	The	truth	is	that	you	can’t	do	it
all,	so	you’re	going	to	have	to	make	choices.	Be	practical.	Raising	your	self-
awareness	and	suffocating	any	self-delusion	is	a	crucial	piece	of	keeping	you	on
the	path	to	success,	however	you	define	it.
Crushing	it	follows	the	laws	of	thermodynamics:	whatever	energy	you	put	into
something	will	manifest	itself	in	equal	amounts	when	it	comes	out.	Sometimes
that	resulting	energy	gets	harnessed	to	move	muscles	or	machines;	sometimes	it
dissipates,	unused,	into	the	ether.	A	successful	entrepreneur	is	one	who	puts	in

enough	energy	to	move	the	gears	and	executes	well	enough	so	the	work	isn’t
wasted.
How	I’m	Crushing	It
Deon	Graham,	Digital	Architect
IG:	@deon
Deon	 Graham	 was	 a	 tennis	 pro.	 Now	 he’s	 Diddy’s	 digital
director.
He’s	 only	 thirty-one,	 but	 already	 he	 has	 one	 of	 the	 most
coveted	jobs	in	the	marketing	world.
That’s	what	personal	branding	can	do	for	a	person.
This	story	starts	in	2008,	in	Miami.	During	the	day,	Deon	was
teaching	tennis.	At	night,	he	was	spending	too	much	money	at
the	clubs	and	“doing	young	people	stuff.”	He	noticed	there	was
a	 void	 in	 the	 marketplace.	 Clubs	 wanted	 to	 market	 only	 to	 a
certain	type—white,	Hispanic,	etc.—and	while	they	liked	having
hip-hop	parties	because	the	revenue	was	good,	they	shied	away
from	projecting	the	image	of	having	a	heavy	hip-hop	crowd.	No
marketing	 company	 was	 focusing	 on	 clubs	 that	 catered	 to	 an
urban	or	hip-hop	audience.	So	Deon	decided	he	would.
He	 created	 the	 nightlife	 website	 City	 Never	 Sleeps.	 By
offering	to	market	the	club	brands	on	his	site,	he	circumvented
the	owners’	 reluctance	 to	 prominently	 market	 their	 hip-hop
nights.	Partygoers	got	access	to	their	photos,	and	club	owners
got	access	to	patrons.	People	loved	the	site,	so	he	knew	he	was
on	to	something,	but	there	was	no	money	in	it.
But	Deon	says	that	was	kind	of	his	fault.	“I	was	just	trying	to
make	deals	and	make	moves	for	a	profit.	I	wasn’t	trying	to	build
a	 brand.	 I	 wasn’t	 committed	 to	 the	 branding	 process;	 I	 was
committed	to	try	to	make	money.”
It	wasn’t	until	he	started	to	dive	into	Crush	It!	principles	and
focus	on	building	a	brand	for	the	long	term	that	things	started	to
turn	around.	He	started	being	more	selective	about	the	caliber	of
clubs	he	worked	with,	turning	down	money	if	he	didn’t	think	the

club	 was	 on	 brand	 and	 would	 lead	 to	 bigger	clients.	 “All	 my
decision	 making	 changed.	 The	 reactions	 I	 was	 getting	 from
people	changed,	and	not	coincidentally,	the	checks	started	to	get
bigger.”
He’d	been	engaging	people	on	Twitter	and	Facebook,	but	not
as	much	as	he	should	have	been.	He	started	watching	Gary	Vee.
“This	guy	has	all	these	followers,	he	looks	like	he	has	a	more
successful	business	than	me,	but	every	day	he’s	on	social	media
talking	to	people,	giving	them	advice,	giving	them	free	content.
So	why	am	I	not	doing	that?”
He	doubled	down	on	the	engagement.	“It	was	24/7.	Literally
anybody	mentioning	anything,	I	would	join	conversations,	reply
to	everybody.	If	it	was	two	a.m.	and	there	was	a	popping	party
going	on,	we	were	in	those	conversations,	letting	people	know
about	other	parties	in	the	city.	There	was	no	room	for	anything
else.”	After	landing	a	contract	with	a	prominent	nightlife	group,
he	felt	secure	enough	to	quit	his	day	job.
The	 site’s	 popularity	 rose	 quickly	 until	 his	 was	 the	 biggest
platform	 catering	 to	 the	 urban	 and	 hip-hop	 market.	 He	 was
approached	by	 Cîroc	 vodka’s	 marketing	 team,	 Blue	 Flame
Agency.
“They	asked,	‘Did	you	make	this	site?’”
“Yeah.”
“We’ve	paid	people	$75,000	to	build	a	website.”
“I	 said,	 ‘I’ll	 do	 it	 for	 $10,000.’	 I	 just	 wanted	 to	 get	 in	 the
building.”
And	he	did.	Blue	Flame	Agency	hired	him,	and	from	then	on
he	was	busy	with	project	after	project.	For	two-and-a-half	years,
he	brokered	deals	with	Hennessy,	LVMH	(Louis	Vuitton	Moët
Hennessy),	 any	 brand	 you	 could	 think	 of	 that	 would	 want	 to
reach	the	urban	nightlife	consumer.
In	2015,	Aubrey	Flynn	of	Combs	Enterprises	offered	Deon	a
position	 as	 his	 digital	 director,	 working	 with	 eight	 different
brands,	including	a	tequila,	a	TV	network,	and	a	music	label.
It’s	a	busy	life.	Deon	has	a	family,	so	a	lot	of	the	work	is	done
after	his	three	kids	are	asleep	and	before	everyone	wakes	up.	His
in-box	has	been	flooded	with	requests	for	speaking	engagements
since	 his	 mention	 in	 the	 May	 2017	 issue	 of	Entrepreneur
magazine.

He’s	got	massive	ambition,	and	nothing	is	going	to	get	in	his
way.
I’m	 definitely	 going	 to	 have	 a	 digital	 agency	 similar	 to	 what	 Gary’s
running,	doing	what	I	do	for	Sean	Combs	with	many	different	brands
and	celebrities.
Sometimes	 I	 go	 to	 these	 meetings,	 and	 you	 kind	 of	 get	 a	 different
look,	just	based	on	being	a	young	black	male.	That’s	actually	been	the
hardest	part,	getting	taken	seriously	by	the	corporate	world.	That’s	why
it’s	good	to	be	aligned	with	someone	like	Sean	Combs,	who	fights	for
that.	 But	 it’s	 definitely	 a	 different	 conversation	 when	 I	 go	 into	 these
rooms,	 than	 for	 say,	 Gary.	I	 walk	 in	 the	 door	 and	 they	 definitely	 get
surprised.	You	can	tell	they	were	thinking	or	looking	for	someone	else.
It’s	just	something	I	gotta	deal	with;	can’t	use	it	as	an	excuse.
The	most	important	thing	is	to	be	fully	committed	and	to	block	out
any	noise,	because	nobody	has	done	what	you’re	attempting	to	do.	And
the	only	way	to	get	it	is	to	put	the	blinders	on	and	push	forward.
Attention
Where	are	the	eyeballs	going?	What	are	your	customers	talking	about?	What	are
the	newest	trends	in	your	field?	What	are	the	biggest	controversies?	You	have	to
pay	attention	to	everything.	One	of	my	great	advantages	has	been	the	ability	to
see	where	the	attention	is	shifting	even	as	my	competition	is	looking	elsewhere
(usually	 backward).	 Knowing	 how	 to	 spot	 underpriced	or	 underappreciated
attention	 is	 a	 key	 influencer	 skill.	 People	 have	 always	 dismissed	 or
underestimated	the	new	thing,	from	radio	to	TV,	from	the	Internet	to	the	social
networks.	They’re	the	same	people	who	believe	that	Hollywood,	not	YouTube
and	Instagram,	 still	 incubates	 the	 biggest	 stars.	 As	 anyone	 under	 the	 age	 of
twenty-five	will	tell	you,	they’re	wrong.
Don’t	become	so	comfortable	on	one	platform	that	you	don’t	take	the	time	to
develop	solid	skills	on	the	others.	On	the	other	hand,	don’t	cling	to	your	favorite
even	when	it’s	become	ineffective	or	overpriced.	Keep	experimenting	even	when
you’re	sure	you’re	doing	it	right.	Your	willingness	to	risk	discomfort	will	save
you	in	the	long	run.	There	are	a	lot	of	you	whose	competitors	were	mastering
Instagram	 five	 years	 ago	 just	 in	 case	 it	 got	 really	 big,	 while	 you	 were	 still
debating	whether	to	get	an	account.	Don’t	make	that	mistake	again.

How	I’m	Crushing	It
Andrew	Nguyen,	Brand	with	Drew
IG:@brandwithdrew
“My	market	started	on	Facebook,	then	jumped	onto	Twitter.
They	 got	 away	 from	 Facebook,	 then	 jumped	 onto	 Instagram.
They	got	away	from	Twitter,	then	jumped	back	into	Facebook.
And	Snapchat,	too.”	Where	the	attention	goes,	so	goes	Andrew
Nguyen.
Andrew	may	follow	the	eyeballs,	but	he	has	always	marched
to	his	own	beat.	At	seventeen,	he	tried	to	follow	a	traditional
path	and	please	his	immigrant	parents	by	accepting	a	scholarship
to	 a	 small	 school	 in	 Hampton,	 Virginia,	 with	 the	 intention	of
studying	 to	 become	 a	 pharmacist.	 By	 the	 end	 of	 the	 first
semester,	he	was	failing	almost	every	class.	Thinking	it	might
suit	him	better,	he	switched	over	to	a	five-year	MBA	program.
He	didn’t	tell	his	parents.
It	 was	 summer	 before	 he	 finally	 confessed.	 Naturally,	 they
were	livid.	They	also	pointed	out	that	if	he	was	just	going	to	get
an	MBA,	he	could	go	to	school	in	their	home	state	of	Maryland
and	 get	 his	 degree	 for	 a	 lot	 less	 money.	 But	 Andrew	 wasn’t
willing	 to	 leave	 Hampton,	 because	 he	 had	 already	 started
making	a	name	for	himself	there—first	as	a	barber.	Andrew	had
learned	to	cut	his	own	hair	from	his	father,	who	had	attended
barber	school	after	arriving	in	the	United	States	from	Vietnam.
When	Andrew	 realized	 he	 was	 in	 a	 dorm	 full	 of	 men	 who
needed	 haircuts,	 he	 saw	 opportunity	 and	 hung	 a	 barber	 sign
outside	his	door.	Business	was	good;	sometimes	he	cut	ten	or
more	heads	per	day.	He	was	also	gaining	a	reputation	as	a	DJ.
He’d	noticed	that	the	most	popular	DJ	on	campus	was	a	senior.
Someone	was	going	to	have	to	take	his	place	when	he	graduated.
He	thought,	Why	not	me?	He	used	his	barber	money	to	buy	a	set
of	speakers	and	some	DJ	equipment	and	had	them	sent	to	the
dorm.	He	started	out	doing	a	few	events	for	free,	again	building
his	brand,	until	the	reigning	DJ	noticed	his	potential	and	took
him	under	his	wing,	making	the	necessary	introductions	to	get

Andrew	good	paying	clients.	“I	truly	felt	this	was	something	I
was	meant	to	do.	I	was	meant	to	stay	at	this	school,	meant	to
meet	 the	 people	 that	 I	 was	 to	 meet,	 meant	 to	 grow	 these
businesses.	I	got	to	the	point	where,	once	I	realized	that	I	truly
believed	in	this	vision,	I	was	willing	to	do	whatever	it	took	to	do
it.”
Andrew’s	mother	and	father	were	not	pleased	and	essentially
disowned	him.	He	was	on	his	own,	without	even	enough	money
to	pay	for	lodging.	He	wound	up	living	in	his	car	and	working	in
the	school	cafeteria	so	he’d	have	access	to	food.	He	became	a
reservist	 in	 the	 US	 Marine	 Corps	 to	 help	 pay	 his	 tuition.
Eventually,	however,	he	built	his	DJ	brand	into	a	thriving	six-
figure	business	serving	the	campus	and	the	city	(his	predecessor-
turned-mentor,	 Taylor	 Austin	 James,	 would	 become	 better
known	as	DJ	Tay	James,	Justin	Bieber’s	official	DJ).
Andrew	didn’t	have	to	cut	hair	anymore,	but	he	was	marked
by	 the	 months	 of	 homelessness.	 Saving	 money	 became	 his
priority.	He	 decided	 to	 use	 his	 MBA	 to	 get	 a	 job	 that	 would
allow	him	to	build	up	a	financial	foundation	as	well	as	teach	him
the	 logistics	of	 the	 corporate	 world.	 He	 took	 a	 sales	 and
marketing	job	with	Pepsi.	At	the	same	time,	he	decided	to	start
his	own	marketing	agency,	the	O	Agency.
“My	 passion	 wasn’t	 barbering	 or	 DJ-ing.	 My	 passion	 was
branding	 myself	 to	 become	 this	 DJ,	 this	 facade,	 this	 brand.
There’s	a	psychological	quality	to	branding	and	marketing	that’s
sometimes	hard	to	quantify.	You	have	to	care	and	show	people
the	quality	of	who	you	are	and	what	you	do.”
To	test	his	knowledge	and	skills,	he	also	decided	to	develop	a
marketing	plan	for	his	friend	Bakari	Taylor,	a	trainer	who	had
earned	 some	 local	 notoriety	 for	 his	 brand,	 Body	 by	 Bakari,
through	a	series	of	free	boot	camps	he	had	held	around	the	DC
area	 the	 summer	 before.	 Taylor	 had	 the	 skills	 and	 charisma,
Andrew	had	the	business	and	marketing	background.	Together,
they	 launched	 a	 big	 branding	 initiative,	 an	 East	 Coast	 No
Excuses	tour	to	help	build	brand	awareness.
The	 tour	 was	 a	 huge	 success,	 but	 it	 almost	 broke	 Andrew.
“That	was	the	hardest	year	of	my	life,	even	past	sleeping	in	my
car	and	 going	 into	 the	 Marine	 Corps.	 I	 knew	 that	 most
businesses	 fail,	 I	 knew	 that	 the	 odds	 were	 against	 me,	 and	 I

knew	that	I	was	not	supposed	to	make	it,	so	I	was	waking	up	at
four	or	five	in	the	morning	to	work	twelve-hour	days	for	Pepsi,
then	 working	six	 p.m.	 to	 two	 a.m.,	 putting	 in	 time	 for	 the	 O
Agency	and	Bakari.	And	I	was	still	DJ-ing,	too.”
Thank	God	Pepsi	made	energy	drinks,	which	Andrew	could
get	for	free.
Within	one	year,	he	was	done.	He	quit	the	DJ	business	and	put
in	 his	 two-weeks’	 notice	 at	 Pepsi.	 Within	 six	 months	 of
launching	the	 O	 Agency,	 he’d	 acquired	 his	 first	 NFL	 client.
Today	he	works	with	brands	like	7-Eleven	and	Sotheby’s.
He	 read	Crush	 It!	only	 about	 two	 years	 ago,	 but	 it	 was
reaffirming.	“Hearing	someone	who’s	many,	many	levels	ahead
of	 me	 saying	 things	 that	I’ve	already	thought	.	.	.	the	overall
mentality	 is	 what	 really	 excites	 me.	 There	 was	 so	 much
confirmation	that	I	was	doing	the	right	thing.”
Until	 recently,	 he	 always	 prioritized	 the	 O	 Agency	 brand,
preferring	to	wait	until	he	had	something	to	show	for	his	efforts
before	putting	his	personal	brand	forward.
“You	can	brand	yourself	all	you	want,	but	if	you	don’t	have
credibility	or	have	not	done	anything,	it’s	almost	worthless.	You
can	only	sell	something	that’s	actually	good.”
Now	 that	 he	 has	 been	 able	 to	 “liberate”	 himself	 from	 the
business,	 he	 has	 started	 building	 his	 personal	 brand,
@BrandwithDrew.
I’m	at	a	point	right	now	where	I	realize	I	will	probably	never	be	broke
again	in	my	life.	I’ve	truly	found	my	passion.	And	one	of	the	things	I
truly	want	to	do	is	help	out	a	lot	of	people	who	are	lost,	especially	the
millennial	 market.	 I	 would	 go	even	 deeper	 by	 saying	 the	 minority
market.	That’s	the	niche	that	I’m	really	going	after	and	putting	myself	in
a	position	where	I	can	really	help	people	out.	It’s	not	about	the	money.	I
do	a	lot	of	things	for	free	because	I	care	more	about	impact	than	the
monetary	things.
I	don’t	even	consider	what	I’m	doing	as	work	anymore.	I	enjoy	what	I
do	so	much.	I	want	to	continue	speaking	and	building	my	own	brand	and
writing	books	and	creating	events	that	help	people.	I	would	love	to	do
that	for	the	rest	of	my	life.
These	are	the	first	seven	essentials	to	a	strong	personal	brand.	I	hope	they	sound

familiar	to	readers	of	the	original	Crush	It!	It	would	be	impossible	to	say	these
things	too	much	or	too	often.	You	know	how	I	know?	Because	for	the	number	of
times	I	repeat	myself	every	year,	there	should	be	thousands	and	thousands	more
of	you	reaching	your	goals.	The	only	explanation	that	such	a	large	percentage	of
you	 aren’t	 is	 that	 you’re	 not	 taking	 me	 at	 my	 word.	 I	 exaggerate	 a	 lot	 for
emphasis	and	entertainment,	but	I	am	not	kidding	when	I	tell	you	that	if	you
scrimp	in	any	way	on	any	one	of	these	building	blocks,	you	will	falter.	It’s	just
the	truth.
There’s	an	eighth	essential.	It’s	the	only	one	that	has	seen	some	significant
developments	over	the	years.	It’s	so	important,	it	deserves	a	chapter	of	its	own.

3
The	Eighth	Essential—Content
To	monetize	your	personal	brand	into	a	business	using	social	marketing	networks,	two	pillars
need	to	be	in	place:	product	and	content.
—Crush	It!,	chapter	5
It’s	still	true	that	the	right	product	and	content	will	be	key	to	building	a	vibrant
personal	brand.	That	part	never	changes.	But	how	you	develop	your	content	and
increase	 its	 reach	 definitely	 has.	 In	Crush	It!	 I	 recommended	 simultaneously
pumping	out	content	onto	all	the	different	channels	using	a	social-media	Web
service	(anyone	remember	Ping.fm?).	It	was	only	later,	however,	that	I	realized
there	had	been	another	misunderstanding.	I	should	have	specified	that	I	didn’t
mean	you	should	pump	out	the	same	content	across	multiple	platforms.	Rather,	I
wanted	you	to	develop	high-quality	native	microcontent.	For	those	of	you	new	to
this,	that	means	content	that	is	specifically	and	perfectly	designed	to	suit	the
platform	you’re	using	to	disseminate	it.	The	audience	on	Twitter	isn’t	looking	for
the	 same	 kind	 of	 content	 as	 Instagram	 followers.	 A	 Facebook	 post	 will	 have
greater	impact	if	it’s	not	just	a	cut-and-paste	job	from	your	blog	or	a	ten-minute
video	that	should	actually	be	living	on	YouTube.	Even	if	your	audience	overlaps
among	the	platforms,	people	are	in	a	completely	different	mind-set	when	they’re
visiting	one	platform	than	when	visiting	another.	If	they’re	on	Twitter,	they’re
likely	 trying	 to	 keep	 up	 with	 current	 news.	 If	 they’re	on	 Facebook,	 they’re
probably	 catching	 up	 with	 friends	 and	 family.	 They	 may	 go	 to	 Snapchat	 to

consume	a	blip	of	entertainment	on	their	lunch	break,	but	they’ll	go	to	YouTube
when	they’re	in	the	mood	to	settle	in	for	the	evening	with	some	long-form	video,
the	same	way	previous	generations	watched	TV.	You	should	be	plotting	how	to
adapt	your	content	to	appeal	to	every	platform	your	audience	might	visit	in	a
given	day.
Creating	all	that	content	can	seem	daunting,	but	it’s	a	lot	more	manageable	if
you	focus	on	creating	one	big	piece	of	pillar	content	that	can	be	splintered	into
other	smaller	bits	of	content—content	that	breeds	like	rabbits,	if	you	will.	The
concept	can	 best	 be	 illustrated	 by	 a	 chart	 my	 team	 and	 I	 created	 for
VaynerTalent,	a	division	of	VaynerMedia	I	established	for	influencers	who	have
grown	their	personal	brands	as	big	as	they	can	on	their	own	and	need	extra	help
to	 keep	 growing.	 It’s	 a	 service	 for	the	 1	 percent	 of	 the	 1	 percent.	 If	 you’re
reading	this	book,	you’re	likely	not	there	yet,	but	I	hope	to	teach	you	what	you
need	to	know	so	that	if	you	get	good	enough,	you’ll	need	us	one	day.	Anyway,
we	use	a	chart	to	illustrate	our	strategy	for	creating	endless	bits	of	microcontent
out	of	one	“pillar”	piece	of	content:
What	those	pieces	of	content	actually	look	like,	and	the	platforms	you	choose	to
use,	is	what	you’re	here	to	figure	out.	More	on	that	in	part	II.
In	Crush	It!	I	also	established	that	great	content	is	a	result	of	passion	plus
expertise.	While	the	opportunities	for	people	to	become	stars	on	various	social-
media	platforms	have	multiplied,	to	have	a	prayer	of	becoming	even	the	eighty-
eighth	best	whiskey	Instagrammer,	you’re	going	to	have	to	make	sure	that	you
are	constantly	updating	your	knowledge	and	providing	information	and	insight
that	people	can’t	find	easily	anywhere	else.	Moreover,	you’ll	have	to	do	it	in	a
unique	and	memorable	signature	style.	There’s	no	way	around	it—your	content
must	 be	 amazing.	 For	 some	 that	 reality	 can	 be	 as	 paralyzing	 as	 a	 snakebite.
Here’s	the	antivenin:	you	don’t	have	to	wait	until	you’re	an	expert	or	you’ve

designed	a	perfect	website	or	written	ten	perfect	blog	posts	before	launching	a
business.	Quite	the	contrary.
Document,	Don’t	Create
In	 2009,	 I	 devoted	 only	 three	 lines	 to	 the	 idea	 that	 “you	 can	 even	 make	 the
learning	process	part	of	your	content.”	It	was	an	aside,	a	possible	solution	if	you
were	young	or	still	building	cred.	Since	then	I’ve	come	to	realize	that,	actually,
the	learning	process	should	be	your	content.	That	means	it’s	not	a	problem	if
you’ve	got	more	passion	than	expertise.	Our	best-loved	icons	aren’t	the	ones
born	to	the	manor	who	stayed	in	the	manor.	They’re	the	ones	who	started	out
tinkering	in	their	basements,	who	sold	product	out	of	the	backs	of	their	cars,	who
rose	and	fell	and	rose	again.	The	only	ones	we	can’t	forgive	are	people	who
won’t	admit	to	their	imperfections	or	own	their	mistakes.
It’s	true	that	great	content	hinges	on	great	storytelling	and	that	every	story	in
the	universe	has	already	been	told.	But	not	by	you.	You	are	unique,	and	you
provide	nuance,	perspective,	and	details	that	no	one	else	can.	That	means	you
don’t	just	have	the	ability	to	generate	unique	pieces	of	creative—you	are	 the
unique	piece	of	creative.	Don’t	worry	about	getting	people’s	attention	by	plotting
a	poetic	YouTube	video	or	writing	four	drafts	of	a	snappy	Facebook	status	post.
Instead,	 use	 every	 platform	 available	 to	 document	 your	 actual	 life	 and	 speak
your	truth.	Let	people	learn	who	you	are,	then	let	them	watch	you	develop	into
who	you	want	to	become.
At	the	end	of	2015,	DRock,	my	videographer,	started	following	me	around
with	a	video	camera	everywhere	I	went	during	work	hours.	The	only	time	the
camera	 was	 turned	 off	 was	 during	 sensitive	 meetings	 or	 when	 I	 went	 to	 the
bathroom.	I	wanted	people	to	see	what	hustle	really	looked	like,	how	I	could
squeeze	so	much	productivity	into	every	minute	(and	incidentally,	to	prove	that
even	when	you’ve	“made	it”	and	are	“important,”	you	don’t	have	to	act	like	an
arrogant	jerk	to	the	people	you	interact	with	on	a	day-to-day	basis,	especially
those	 working	 in	 service	 jobs).	 It	 was	 important	 to	 me	 to	 address	 a	 frequent
speculation	I	was	seeing	in	my	feeds,	which	was	that	I	was	exaggerating	how
many	hours	I	worked	per	day.	I	wanted	people	to	see	that	when	I	said	I	worked
from	about	six	a.m.	to	ten	p.m.	Monday	through	Friday,	I	was	serious.	Moreover,
I	have	been	working	those	hours	for	about	a	decade.
Most	important,	however,	I	wanted	to	provide	a	learning	tool	for	the	kind	of

people	 built	 like	 me.	 I	 learn	 by	 watching	 and	doing,	 not	 by	 reading.	 It’s	 not
uncommon	for	me	to	get	a	message	from	someone	who	tells	me	that	they	picked
up	something	valuable	from	watching	me	interact	with	people	on-screen	or	from
a	random	rant	that	I	offered	from	the	back	of	the	car.	In	most	cases,	I’m	almost
positive	that	that	moment	meant	nothing	to	anyone	else,	but	to	hear	that	on	that
day	I	was	able	to	help	one	person	means	the	world	to	me.	I	can’t	take	a	meeting
with	every	person	who	wants	my	advice,	but	I	can	teach	by	example	and	let
them	learn	from	that.	None	of	us	can	predict	with	utmost	certainty	exactly	what’s
going	to	happen	to	us.	We	will	probably	meet	the	people	we	arrange	to	meet,	but
we	could	also	have	random	encounters.	We	will	probably	have	the	conversations
we	have	scheduled,	but	who	knows	where	those	talks	might	go?	Documenting
guarantees	 that	 every	 encounter	 and	 every	 engagement	 is	 captured	 so	I	 can
ensure	that	I’m	never	caught	off	guard	when	I	experience	a	moment	that	could
spark	a	valuable	piece	of	content	for	my	followers.	Documenting	has	liberated
me	from	the	pressure	of	having	to	create	all	the	time.
Use	Snapchat,	Instagram	Stories,	YouTube	videos,	and	Facebook	Live	three,
four,	five	times	per	day	to	share	the	world	through	your	eyes.	Let	your	audience
meet	 your	 cranky	 uncle,	 let	 them	 see	 what	 you’re	 eating	 for	 lunch,	 let	 them
follow	you	as	you	slog	through	the	workout	you	love	to	hate.	Invite	them	 in
when	you	move	into	your	first	postdivorce	apartment	or	your	college	dorm.	Take
them	along	on	your	vacations	and	business	trips.	Think	of	yourself	as	the	star	of
this	show	and	the	production	company.
Is	everything	about	your	daily	life	inherently	interesting	and	new?	In	the	right
hands,	yes.	It’s	not	easy	to	make	a	personal	documentary,	but	it’s	a	hell	of	a	lot
easier	than	trying	to	produce	Modern	Family.	And	which	do	you	think	you’ll	get
done	faster?	What’s	the	cost?	It’s	worth	a	try.	Maybe	you’ll	hate	it	(it	took	me
several	months	to	get	used	to	having	a	camera	follow	me	wherever	I	went),	and
maybe	you’ll	fail.	But	maybe	you’ll	build	the	audience	that	earns	you	$80K	a
year,	 or	 $380K,	 which	 can	 come	 through	 the	 ads,	 affiliates,	 speaking
engagements,	 books,	 sponsorship	deals,	 and	 other	 ancillary	 revenue-earning
opportunities	that	come	from	having	a	strong	personal	brand.	You	never	know
what	you’re	going	to	put	out	that	inspires	someone	important	to	reach	out	to	you.
People	 who	 see	 your	 work	 will	 come	 to	 you	 with	ideas	 and	 offers	 and
partnerships.	They	will	buy	into	you	if	you	give	them	the	right	story.	At	the	very
least,	even	if	you	don’t	become	the	next	Kardashian,	you’ll	likely	find	that	you
can	 healthily	 supplement	 your	 current	 income	 doing	 something	that	 you	 find
interesting	and	fun.
Documenting	to	build	a	personal	brand	is	an	especially	good	tactic	if	you’re
already	working	a	job	that	you	want	to	leave	someday.	Build	your	brand	and

gain	traction	in	your	niche	before	you	ever	need	to	make	any	money,	so	that
when	you	are	ready	to	step	out	of	your	current	job,	your	brand	is	there	to	hold
you	up	and	carry	you	to	your	next	opportunity.
Now,	this	tactic	solves	only	one	hurdle:	how	to	build	cred	when	you	have
none	yet.	However,	it	cannot	help	you	if	your	content	sucks.	Sorry,	there’s	no
skirting	the	fact	that	any	success	you	achieve	will	be	predicated	on	the	quality	of
your	content.	Don’t	think	you	can	put	out	mediocre	videos	and	blogs	and	get
anything	but	mediocre	results,	just	as	you	can’t	think	that	putting	out	a	half-
assed	effort	will	get	you	even	halfway	to	where	you	want	to	go.	That	said,	just
because	you	suck	now	doesn’t	mean	you’re	always	going	to	suck.	Many	of	the
entrepreneurs	we	spoke	to	didn’t	know	what	they	were	doing	when	they	first
started	vlogging	or	podcasting	either,	and	it	showed.	But	they	worked	at	it	every
day,	analyzing	their	content,	engaging	with	audiences	to	see	what	resonated	and
what	didn’t,	and	studying	other	personal	brands	to	see	what	strategies	they	could
adapt	for	themselves.	They	practiced	their	craft	as	intensely	and	methodically	as
a	surgical	resident	practices	her	stitches	or	a	preprofessional	basketball	player
practices	his	layups.
Documenting	will	keep	you	honest.	It	makes	me	laugh	when	I	see	nineteen-
year-olds	 and	 fresh	 college	 grads	 anoint	 themselves	on	 Instagram	 profiles	 as
“entrepreneur	experts,”	or	“social-media	life	coaches.”	Like	hell	they	are.	Very,
very	few	have	earned	the	right	to	those	titles.	Young	girls	will	put	up	profiles
announcing	 that	 they’re	 beauty	 experts.	 No,	 they’re	 beauty	 opinionators.	You
don’t	get	to	call	yourself	an	expert	until	you’ve	put	in	the	work—and	the	market
decides,	not	you.	When	I	was	a	kid,	I	would	sit	next	to	my	dad	in	the	car	and	tell
him	that	I	was	going	to	be	a	wine	expert	and	build	the	biggest	liquor	store	in	the
country.	I	couldn’t	drink,	so	I	spent	all	the	years	until	my	twenty-first	birthday
tasting	all	the	things	critics	and	wine	labels	said	wine	tasted	like—grass,	dirt,
cherries,	tobacco—to	develop	my	palate	while	I	learned	the	business.	It	was	only
when	 I	 was	 of	 age	 and	 sure	 I	 had	 something	 of	 real,	 unique	 value	 to	 offer
customers	that	I	went	public	and	started	building	a	brand	around	my	expertise.	I
was	thirty	years	old	and	had	been	in	the	business	of	tasting	hundreds	of	wines
per	week	for	a	decade.
If	I	could	give	some	advice	to	my	seventeen-year-old	self,	I’d	tell	him	to	turn
on	the	camcorder	and	capture	every	minute	of	his	training.	How	fantastic	would
it	be	to	be	able	to	share	with	people	the	first	time	I	tasted	dirt?	I	could	have
filmed	myself	 tasting	 thirty-five	 different	 Merlots	 and	 telling	 the	 audience,
“Someday	I’m	going	to	be	able	to	tell	you	which	is	which	while	blindfolded,”
and	then	three	years	later	I	could	have	filmed	myself	blind	taste-testing	a	row	of
red	wines	and	correctly	identifying	those	Merlots.	And	then	I	could	have	created

some	content	that	juxtaposed	those	two	videos	and	showed	the	world	how	far	I
had	come.	It	would	have	been	honest,	and	it	would	have	been	great	storytelling.
At	twenty-six	I	was	going	to	be	who	I	am	today;	it’s	a	shame	the	whole	process
of	getting	here	has	been	lost	to	history.	Sure,	I	tell	my	story	in	books	and	during
keynotes,	 but	 imagine	 the	 detailed	 lessons	 I	 could	 have	 shared,	 the	 mistakes
people	could	have	watched	me	make,	the	learning	curve	I	could	have	provided,
if	only	I	had	thought	to	document	my	life	in	the	moment.	The	beauty	expert
wannabes	could	 do	 the	 same	 thing.	 Instead	 of	 going	 to	 the	 department	 store,
getting	makeup	advice	from	the	reps	at	the	cosmetics	counter,	and	then	filming
themselves	regurgitating	the	information	as	though	it	were	their	own,	they	could
film	 themselves	 asking	 questions	at	 the	 makeup	 counter,	 educating	 their
audience	while	educating	themselves.	Then	they	could	build	content	with	that
new	knowledge	and	refer	to	that	video	over	and	over.
Documenting	isn’t	valuable	because	it	captures	how	interesting	(or	not)	you
are	now;	it’s	about	preparing	for	how	people	will	watch	you	ten	years	from	now.
Cassius	Clay	was	only	twenty-one	when	he	declared,	“I	am	the	greatest.”	But
then	he	went	about	proving	it	and	became	Muhammad	Ali.	Why	can’t	you	do	the
same,	even	on	a	smaller	level?	Think	about	how	you	feel	when	you	watch	a	clip
of	 Justin	 Bieber	 singing	 when	 he	 was	 twelve,	 or	 video	 footage	 of	 Michael
Jackson	 rehearsing	 for	 the	Thriller	video	 in	 a	 dance	 studio	 with	 his
choreographer.	 Can	 you	 imagine	 if	 we	 could	 watch	 Vera	 Wang	 cut	 her	 first
patterns	and	sew	her	first	wedding	dresses?	Or	if	we	could	be	privy	to	George
Lucas’s	thoughts	as	he	developed	ideas	for	his	student	films	at	the	University	of
Southern	 California?	 Not	 the	 way	 we	 can	 now	 through	 a	 biography	 or
interviews,	but	captured	verbatim	in	the	moment,	before	they	could	be	subject	to
the	mental	editing	we	all	apply	to	our	memories	over	time?	It’s	an	amazing	thing
to	see	talent	grow	and	to	bear	witness	to	the	evolution	of	greatness.	Someday,
you	could	be	that	kind	of	inspiration	to	others	if	you	capture	the	journey.
Documenting	 also	 gives	 you	 an	 archive	 to	 work	 with	 that	 can	 help	 you
validate	your	early	promises	or,	as	I	like	to	call	it,	earn	your	keep.	For	example,
people	thought	I	was	crazy	in	2012	when	I	said	that	Facebook	stole	Instagram
when	 it	 bought	 the	company	 for	 a	 billion	 dollars.	 I	 get	 ridiculous	 pleasure
releasing	that	old	footage	now	that	as	of	its	last	valuation,	Instagram	is	worth
$50	 billion	 (and	 much	 more,	 in	 my	 opinion).	 Documenting	 your	 business
ensures	that	you’ll	have	many	opportunities	to	say,	“I	told	you	so.”	I	recently
filmed	a	meeting	with	Kyle,	a	rapper	Rolling	Stone	picked	as	one	of	“10	New
Artists	 You	 Need	 to	 Know”	 in	 2015.	 We	 talked	 music	 and	 marketing	 and
songwriting,	 and	 it	 was	 awesome.	In	 ten	 years,	 when	 he’s	 as	 well	 known	 as
Eminem,	that	video	is	going	to	be	viewed	thousands	and	thousands	more	times

by	 his	fans.	 For	 many,	 that	 will	 be	 their	 introduction	 to	 me.	 Even	 more
awesome	.	.	.	for	me—;	).
A	lot	of	pseudo-experts	will	justify	subterfuge	by	saying	they’re	just	taking
the	 age-old	 advice	 of	 fake	 it	 ’til	 you	 make	it.	 But	 no	 one	 needs	 to	 do	 that
anymore.	The	only	reason	people	used	to	have	to	fake	it	was	because	they	had	to
convince	the	gatekeepers—the	 agents,	 the	 directors,	 the	 publishers,	 the	 music
producers,	 the	 talent	 scouts—to	 give	 them	 the	 shot	 they	 needed	to	 prove
themselves.	 But	 the	 Internet	 plays	 the	 middleman	 role	 now,	 and	 the	 Internet
can’t	stop	you	from	putting	your	work	out	there.	Put	your	stuff	up	and	see	what
the	market	has	to	say	about	it.	Take	it	down	if	no	one	likes	it	(or	keep	it	up	for
historical	reference).	Change	it	up	and	try	again.	Take	risks	and	learn	from	them.
Daniel	 Markham	 of	 the	 What’s	 Inside?	 YouTube	channel,	 which	 boasts	 five
million	subscribers,	launched	several	video	channels	before	he	finally	put	up	the
one	 that	 got	people’s	 attention.	 Once	 it	 started	 gaining	 traction,	 he	 applied
everything	 he	 had	 learned	 from	 his	 failures	 to	 improve	 his	channel’s	content
quality,	user	experience,	and	monetization	strategy.
There’s	another	reason	not	to	fake	it.	The	only	people	who	fall	for	your	act
when	 you	 pretend	 to	 be	 something	 you’re	 not	 are	the	 exact	 same	 customers
you’re	not	going	to	want	in	ten	years	or	even	ten	months.	Simultaneously,	you
lose	credibility	with	the	top	tier	of	customers	you’re	going	to	need	to	grow	and
sustain	your	business.	You’re	sacrificing	long-term	growth	for	short-term	gains,
and	 I	 think	 that	 puts	 entrepreneurs	 in	 a	 vulnerable	 position	 in	 the	 long	 run.
Who’s	going	to	trust	you	when	they	know	you’re	willing	to	snow	the	ignorant?
It	is	not	OK	to	be	manipulative;	it	is	OK	to	be	a	novice.	I	hope	you	understand
the	 difference.	 It’s	 exciting	 to	 watch	 someone	thoughtfully,	 strategically,	 and
intelligently	come	into	their	professional	own.	Embrace	your	newness;	in	many
ways	it	could	give	you	an	advantage.	You	will	likely	have	a	fresh	energy	and
enthusiasm	that	many	more-seasoned	professionals	have	lost.	That’s	attractive.
And	admitting	that	you’re	still	learning	will	give	people	a	reason	to	check	in	on
your	progress.	It	will	also	make	it	that	much	more	exciting	when	you	can	finally
say,	“I	told	you	so.”	Have	you	ever	been	watching	a	movie	or	TV	show	when	the
kid	 who	 used	 to	 star	 in	 all	 the	 school	 plays	 and	 talk	 about	 making	 it	 in
Hollywood	suddenly	appears	on-screen,	or	seen	the	face	of	someone	you	used	to
know	 on	 the	 cover	 of	 a	 national	 magazine?	 It’s	 almost	 impossible	 not	 to	 get
worked	up	about	it.	“Holy	shit,	I	know	him!	He	did	it!”	From	then	on,	whenever
the	conversation	makes	it	possible,	you	will	probably	slip	in	the	fact	that	you
knew	 that	 person	 back	 when	 nobody	 else	 did.	 Now,	 as	 excited	 as	 you	 are,
imagine	how	excited	your	old	acquaintance	is	knowing	that	hundreds	of	his	old
classmates	 are	 having	 the	 same	 reaction,	 especially	 if	 he	 was	 mocked	or	 put

down	for	daring	to	think	he	had	enough	talent	or	smarts	to	be	a	star.	Believe	me,
it	feels	good.	It	will	feel	even	better	if	you’ve	documented	your	journey	up	to
that	point,	so	that	people	can	see	how	hard	you	worked	to	make	it	happen.	If
enough	of	us	start	to	document,	we	could	completely	destroy	the	myth	of	the
overnight	success.
Put	your	stuff	out	in	public	so	you	have	to	live	up	to	it.	As	long	as	it’s	valuable
and	you	know	it’s	true,	don’t	judge	it.	Let	the	market	show	you	whether	you’re
good	or	not.	There’s	always	something	new,	and	the	only	way	to	win	is	if	it’s
your	truth.	Just	produce.	Become	that	personality,	and	own	it.
Your	natural	gifts	can	take	you	only	so	far.	If	you	want	to	be	the	best,	you’ll
have	to	work	at	it,	but	avoid	being	a	perfectionist.	Perfection	doesn’t	exist;	it’s
totally	subjective.	We	earn	people’s	respect	and	loyalty	when	we	let	them	see	us
up	close	and	dirty.	Knowing	that	should	ease	any	misperception	that	you	have	to
start	 this	 process	 fully	 formed.	 Remember,	 there	 was	 a	time	 when	 Kobe	 and
Beyoncé	still	had	to	use	their	last	names.
How	I’m	Crushing	It
Rich	Roll,	Rich	Roll	Enterprises,	LLC
IG:	@richroll
It	was	an	ordinary	flight	of	stairs	that	set	Rich	Roll	on	the
path	to	crushing	it.	The	year	was	2006,	and	the	thirty-nine-year-
old	had	it	all:	a	lucrative	career	as	an	entertainment	lawyer,	a
loving	wife	who	had	enjoyed	her	own	success	as	a	fashion	and
interior	 designer,	 four	 healthy	 children,	 and	 a	 fabulous	 home
nestled	on	three	acres	in	Malibu	Canyon.
He	was	miserable.
For	years	he	had	blindly	chased	the	promise	of	the	American
Dream.	He	had	everything	going	for	him	and	played	the	game
perfectly.	“I	 got	 into	 every	 college	 I	 applied	 to.	 Harvard,
Princeton	 .	 .	 .	 I	 went	 to	 Stanford.	 I	 was	 a	 world-ranked
competitive	swimmer	in	college.	I	graduated	from	Cornell	Law
School	in	1994.	Everything	was	about,	get	into	the	best	school,
study	hard,	get	into	the	best	law	school,	get	the	best	law	firm
job,	work	hard,	show	up	early,	stay	late,	impress	your	bosses,	get

on	the	partnership	track,	buy	the	nice	car.”
He	accomplished	all	this	even	while	secretly	struggling	with	a
debilitating	 drug-and-alcohol	 addiction	 that	 eventually	 came
close	to	ruining	his	life.	Yet	despite	achieving	sobriety	and	all
the	 material	 trappings	 of	 success,	 the	 happiness	 that	 he	had
expected	 remained	 elusive,	 landing	 him	 in	 the	 midst	 of	 an
existential	crisis.
I’d	 looked	 around	 the	 law	 firm,	 and	 I	 didn’t	 aspire	 to	 be	 any	 of	 the
partners	that	I	saw.	I	didn’t	want	their	lives.	It’s	not	that	I	disrespected
them,	it’s	just	they	didn’t	have	anything	that	I	wanted	for	myself.	And
this	created	a	huge	problem	for	me	because	I	had	invested	so	much	time
and	money	and	energy,	years	and	years	of	my	life,	to	get	to	this	place,
and	 I	 felt	I	 was	 stuck.	 I	 didn’t	 know	 how	 to	 get	 out	 of	 it.	 I’d	 never
stopped	to	think,	What	would	make	me	happy?	Or,	What	is	it	that	I’m
passionate	about?	Because	that	was	just	never	part	of	the	conversation.
Then,	 the	 night	 before	 his	 fortieth	 birthday,	 while	 climbing
the	stairs	of	his	home,	Rich	started	sweating	and	had	to	stop	to
catch	 his	 breath.	 He	 realized	 that	 the	 years	 of	 junk	 food	 and
workaholism	that	had	packed	fifty	extra	pounds	onto	his	frame
were	taking	their	toll,
1
	hurtling	him	into	middle	age	on	course	to
the	same	heart	disease	that	had	killed	his	grandfather
2
	at	a	young
age.	In	that	moment,	his	combined	health	and	existential	crises
propelled	him	to	make	a	massive	lifestyle	change.
Literally	overnight,	he	adopted	a	vegetarian	diet	and	started
running.	Within	two	years,	with	the	help	of	his	wife,	who	was
already	a	healthy-living	practitioner	with	an	interest	in	Eastern
healing	 and	 spirituality,	 he	 had	 embraced	 veganism	 and
transformed	himself	 from	 an	 overweight	 couch	 potato	 into	 a
world-class	 ultra-endurance	 athlete.	 He	 had	 also	 left	 the
corporate	law	firm	and	started	his	own	boutique	practice.
It	 basically	 revolutionized	 every	 facet	 of	 my	 life	 physically,	 mentally,
and	emotionally.	I	lost	all	this	weight.	My	skin	cleared	up.	I	felt	amazing.
I	 had	 better	 mental	 acuity.	 I	 slept	 better.	 The	 sheer	 fact	 that	 I	 had
changed	so	dramatically	in	 a	 pretty	 compressed	 time	 period	 made	 me
realize	just	how	resilient	the	body	is.	And	I	got	interested	in	trying	to	test
the	 outer	 boundaries	 of	 that	 for	 myself.	 I	 started	 to	 think,	If	I	could
change	so	dramatically	in	such	a	short	period	of	time,	what	other	leaf
could	I	turn	over?
While	he	felt	great	about	how	far	he	had	moved	away	from

the	lifestyle	choices	that	had	sapped	his	sense	of	possibility,	he
still	wasn’t	sure	what	it	was	he	was	moving	toward.	If	he	could
have	made	a	living	as	an	endurance	athlete,	he	would	have,	but
he	had	a	family	to	support	and	a	mortgage	to	pay,	and	there	was
zero	money	in	endurance	events.
Or	 so	 he	 thought.	 After	 placing	 high	 in	 the	 2008	 Ultraman
World	 Championship,	 a	 double-Ironman,	 three-day,	 320-mile,
ultra-endurance	event	in	Hawaii—and	becoming	the	first	vegan
to	finish	the	race—the	media	started	reaching	out	for	interviews.
Everyone	 wanted	to	 know:	 how	 was	 a	 forty-two-year-old
performing	at	such	incredibly	high	levels	on	a	completely	plant-
based	diet?	It	was	unheard	of.	Suddenly	Rich	became	aware	that
what	 he	 was	 doing	 might	 actually	 be	 of	 interest	 to	 someone
outside	his	nuclear	family.
Rich	had	a	MySpace	and	a	Facebook	account	and	had	started
using	Twitter	relatively	early,	but	he	was	using	these	“like	the
average	human	being.”	Now	aware	that	people	were	interested
in	 knowing	 more	 about	 his	 diet	 and	 training	 regimen,	 he
suggested	to	a	friend	that	they	film	themselves	as	they	trained	at
a	camp	in	Hawaii	for	the	2009	Ultraman	World	Championships.
“We	 bought	one	 of	 those	 little	 flip	 cameras,	 and	 we	 started
making	daily	videos	about	our	training	for	this	crazy	race.	We
were	like,	‘Let	me	show	you	behind	the	scenes.	Here’s	what	I’m
eating.	Here’s	how	I’m	training.’	And	we	would	upload	these	to
YouTube,	just	short	little	five-	or	ten-minute	superhacky	amateur
videos,	 but	 they	 were	 getting	 a	 couple	 thousand	 views!	 I
couldn’t	believe	it.”
It	was	while	training	for	this	race	that	Rich	read	Crush	It!
I	was	already	starting	to	see	the	results	of	what	these	social-media	tools
could	do	for	me,	and	although	I	didn’t	know	how	they	would	translate
into	some	kind	of	tangible	career,	I	believed	in	their	power.	And	I	had
faith	that	by	continuing	to	double	down	on	my	devotion	to	them,	at	some
point	it	would	somehow	pay	a	dividend.	[The	book]	validated	everything
that	 was	 percolating	in	 my	 mind	 and	 gave	 me	 a	 very	 practical	 and
ultimately	very	doable	road	map	to	move	forward.	Perhaps	even	more
important,	I	really	took	to	heart	something	that	Gary	made	very	clear	in
that	book	and	continues	to	make	clear	to	this	day,	which	is	that	you	have
to	have	the	long	view.
I	wasn’t	trying	to	cash	in	on	a	Twitter	following	to	do	a	brand	deal	or
anything	like	that.	I	didn’t	care	about	making	money	on	social	media.
All	 I	 wanted	 to	 do	 was	 deliver	 valuable	 content—entertainment,

information—that	would	be	helpful	to	them,	without	 ever	 looking	 for
anything	in	return.	Because	I	knew	at	some	point—and	that	might	be
years	down	the	line—I	would	be	able	to	call	upon	them	to	come	back
around	for	me.	In	the	meantime,	all	I	cared	about	was	trying	to	cultivate
and	tend	to	this	flock.
[I	wasn’t]	trying	to	grow	it	as	big	as	possible	but	to	make	sure	that	the
people	who	were	paying	attention	to	me	and	had	taken	the	time	to	follow
what	I	was	doing	received	something	of	value	that	would	be	beneficial	in
their	lives.	Approaching	it	from	a	professional	point	of	view	and	shifting
my	mind-set	to	that	of	a	practitioner	was	very	powerful	and	empowering
at	the	same	time.
He	became	more	purposeful.
Instead	 of	 just	 being	 lighthearted	 and	 fun	 about	 it,	 I	 really	 did	 think,
“OK,	what	is	the	purpose	of	this	tweet	or	this	video	or	this	Facebook
post?	What	am	I	delivering	 that’s	 gonna	 be	 of	 value?—whether	 it’s	 a
smoothie	recipe,	a	certain	sort	of	strategy	about	training,	.	.	.	[or	advice
on]	how	to	be	a	parent	and	train	for	a	crazy	race	like	this	and	not	get
divorced.”
The	 following	 year,	 in	 2010,	 Rich	 completed	 the	 EPIC5
Challenge,	 five	 Ironman-distance	 triathlons	 on	 five	 Hawaiian
islands	in	seven	days.
He	doubled	down	on	blogging	and	engaging	with	followers,
earning	 plenty	 of	 rebukes	 from	 those	 close	 to	 him	 for	 being
“distracted”	and	“not	present.”
Rich’s	first	chance	to	monetize	came	about	in	a	way	that	100
percent	supports	my	theory	that	the	number	of	our	social-media
followers	 is	 secondary	 to	 the	 quality	 of	 those	 followers.	 Rich
had	been	blogging	for	about	four	years	when	he	got	a	call	from
Sanjay	Gupta,	chief	medical	correspondent	of	CNN.	Turns	out
Gupta	had	been	reading	the	blog,	and	he	wanted	to	come	to	the
house	for	an	interview.	Rich	suddenly	realized	that	his	days	of
anonymity	might	be	over.	“I	thought,	Oh	my	God!	Millions	of
people	 are	 going	 see	 me	 on	 CNN.	 I	 should	 have	 something
available	on	my	website	for	people	to	buy	if	they’re	interested	in
learning	more	about	how	I’ve	done	what	I’ve	done.	So	I	literally
pulled	an	all-nighter	and	created	an	online	cookbook	with	my
wife’s	amazing	vegan	recipes.”	In	eighteen	hours,	he	had	used
his	 rudimentary	 Photoshop	 skills	 to	 pull	 together	 some
photographs	and	recipes	and	created	an	e-book,	listing	it	on	his
website	for	nine	dollars.

The	interview	went	viral,	and	the	blog	post	he	wrote	for	CNN
was	 number	 one	 on	 the	 network’s	 home	 page	 for	 three	 days
straight.	That	 little	 nine-dollar	 e-cookbook	 that	 Rich	 edited
overnight	paid	the	family	mortgage	for	about	two	years.
Shortly	afterward,	Rich	was	offered	a	$150,000	contract	for
his	first	book,	Finding	Ultra.
I	realized	that	that	book	was	going	to	be	the	fulcrum	that	could	leverage
my	new	life	completely.	So	not	only	did	I	work	incredibly	hard	to	make
that	the	best	book	possible,	but	also	I	worked	doubly	hard	on	marketing
it	once	it	was	done,	because	I	realized,	if	I	didn’t	put	everything	that	I
had	into	getting	that	book	out	there,	it	would	just	come	and	go	like	so
many	books.	And	then	I	would	have	to	go	back	to	being	a	lawyer,	which
was	the	last	thing	I	wanted	to	do.
Rich	was	relentless,	writing	blog	posts	for	anyone	who	would
let	 him	 contribute,	 appearing	 on	 any	 podcast	 that	 would	 give
him	a	slot,	accepting	every	single	interview	he	could	get,	and
speaking	in	front	of	any	and	every	group,	even	if	his	audience
was	only	four	or	five	people.	He	also	recruited	his	social-media
community.	“I	did	call	upon	my	audience	to	say,	‘OK,	here’s	this
book.	Help	me	get	this	out.	Be	my	foot	soldiers.	You	guys	know
how	 much	 content	 I’ve	 delivered	 for	 you.	 If	 you’ve	 gotten
anything	out	of	anything	that	I’ve	delivered	to	you,	I’d	really
appreciate	it	if	you	could	help	me	get	the	word	out	about	this.’”
The	day	Finding	Ultra	hit	the	bookstores	in	2012	was	the	day
Rich	decided	he	was	done	practicing	law.	Sure	that	he	was	now
positioned	to	command	sizable	fees	for	his	appearances,	he	let
his	bar	membership	lapse.	Despite	his	popularity,	however,	the
demand	 still	 wasn’t	there.	 Without	 his	 earnings	 from	 the	 law
practice	 or	 other	 consistent	 revenue	 streams,	 even	 with	 the
money	he	earned	from	the	book	and	his	speaking	engagements,
the	couple	wasn’t	bringing	in	enough	to	support	the	family	long
term.	The	following	years	were	scary	and	lean.
Because	I	have	a	law	degree	from	Cornell	and	a	college	degree	from
Stanford,	it’d	be	very	easy	for	me	to	backpedal	into	a	cushy,	well-paying
job.	So	for	me	the	most	difficult	part	was	to	say	no	to	that	and	to	stay	the
course	even	when	we	were	forty-eight	hours	away	from	our	home	being
foreclosed	on,	even	when	I	couldn’t	put	food	on	the	table,	even	when	my
car	got	repossessed.	I	made	a	lot	of	mistakes,	and	it	could	be	argued	that
I	was	imprudent	in	some	of	the	decisions	that	I	made;	2013	was	a	very
hard	 year.	 There	 were	 some	 dark	 times	 when	 everybody	 I	 knew	 was

telling	me	that	I	was	crazy	and	that	I	was	being	irresponsible.
He	managed	to	secure	a	short-term	job	helping	a	friend	launch
a	media	platform	for	a	new	eco-business	venture	in	Hawaii	and
moved	the	family	there.	A	big	podcast	fan,	Rich	launched	his
own,	The	Rich	Roll	Podcast,	another	platform	where	he	shares
his	personal	insights	and	gives	his	audience	a	chance	to	hear	him
discuss	issues	and	ideas	with	interesting	guests.	It	would	become
hugely	popular	and	retain	a	consistent	spot	in	the	iTunes	podcast
Top	10,	yet	it	would	be	more	than	two	years	before	it	 would
grow	to	the	point	where	he	could	monetize	it	with	ad	revenue.
All	the	while,	he	continued	to	put	out	content	on	his	blog	and
YouTube	channel.	Rich	admits	that	when	he	suffered	self-doubt
and	started	to	question	his	judgment,	it	was	his	wife,	Julie,	who
kept	him	going.	“She	kept	telling	me	that	I	had	to	do	this,	urging
me	not	to	lose	sight	of	the	bigger	picture.	When	I	had	my	dark
night	of	the	soul	and	thought,	This	is	insane.	What	am	I	doing?
she	 was	 the	 one	 who	 said,	 ‘You	 gotta	 keep	 going.’	 We	 were
sleeping	in	a	yurt	in	Hawaii,	and	still	she’d	say,	‘We’ll	work	it
out.’”
The	family	moved	back	to	Los	Angeles,	and	things	started	to
turn	 around.	 The	 bank	 allowed	 them	 to	 renegotiate	 their
mortgage.	Rich’s	 audience	 continued	 to	 grow,	 and	 he	 started
getting	 invited	 to	 appear	 on	 more	 prominent	 podcasts.	 He
booked	more	prestigious	speaking	engagements	for	companies
like	Goldman	Sachs.	He	secured	a	second	book	deal,	and	The
Plantpower	Way	was	published	in	the	spring	of	2015.	His	reach
and	 popularity	 has	 spread	 so	 wide,	 he’s	 now	 considered	 “an
influencer’s	influencer.”

Rich’s	story	has	a	fairy-tale	happy	ending,	but	he’s	quick	to
reiterate	that	the	only	reason	he	is	where	he	is	today	is	because
he	went	all	in	and	had	a	spouse	who	was	willing	to	go	all	in	with
him.	He	is	deeply	aware	of	the	sacrifices	and	hardship	his	family
endured	while	they	waited	for	him	to	find	his	way.
I	had	to	work	my	butt	off	for	many	years	to	get	to	this	point.	I	had	to	be
willing	 to	 lose	 the	 house	 to	 pursue	 this	 dream,	 and	 reconfigure	 my
relationship	 to	 material	 things.	 And	 I	 could	not	 have	 done	 it	 without
Julie;	she	always	held	the	belief	that	it	was	going	to	work	out.	We	risked
everything	to	be	here.	Everything.	And	it	was	all	worth	it,	but	it	wasn’t
easy.	To	this	day,	my	thirteen-year-old	daughter	doesn’t	want	to	go	back

to	Hawaii	because	she	associates	it	with	trauma.	I	have	two	boys,	now
twenty-one	and	twenty-two.	It	was	rough,	but	they	were	also	able	to	see
their	parents	pursuing	what	they	loved,	navigating	hardship	together.	I
think	something	like	this	could	break	up	marriages	and	families.	In	our
case,	 it	 brought	 us	 closer	 together,	 and	 it	 actually	 taught	 the	 boys	 an
important	lesson.	Like,	look,	life	is	difficult.	You	just	don’t	get	what	you
want	when	you	want	it.	The	fact	that	we	were	able	to	get	through	it,	and
get	through	it	together,	was	an	invaluable	lesson	to	them.	And	I	think
that	 has	 allowed	 them	 to	 value	 what	 we	 have	a	 little	 bit	 more	 in	 the
longer	view.	They’ve	said	as	much	to	us.	I’m	wracked	with	guilt	that	my
daughter	associates	Hawaii	with	trauma,	but	I’m	a	better	parent	now	than
I	would	be	if	I	had	had	to	go	back	to	being	a	lawyer	just	so	that	I	could
hold	on	to	a	house,	so	that	my	daughter	won’t	be	upset.	What	kind	of
example	is	that?
I	did	this	because	I	loved	it.	I	was	desperate	to	find	a	new	way	to	live.
I	 love	 doing	 the	 podcast.	 I	 love	 writing	 these	 books.	And	now	every
single	day,	I	get	e-mails	saying,	“You	changed	my	life.	You	have	no	idea
how	much	you’ve	influenced	me.”	And	I’m	sure	Gary	gets	e-mails	like
that	up	the	wazoo,	but	to	me,	the	idea	that	that’s	where	I	am	now	from
where	I	was	not	that	long	ago	is	absolutely	shocking	and	stunning.	And
it’s	 really	 entirely	 attributable	 to	 really	 trying	 to	 understand	 how	 to
become	the	best	practitioner	of	these	incredibly	powerful	social-media
tools	that	have	given	me	this	life	that	I	never	thought	that	I	could	have.
My	advocacy	and	my	message	are	about	the	power	of	transformation.
It’s	about	owning	your	story.	It’s	about	the	courage	to	be	vulnerable.	It’s
about	the	innate	capacity	that	we	all	have	to	not	only	change	but	to	tap
into	 reservoirs	 of	 potential	that	 are	 lying	 dormant.	 And	 it’s	 about
performance.	 The	 fact	 that	 I	 was	 able	 to	 do	 five	 Ironmans	 on	 five
Hawaiian	islands	in	under	a	week	at	age	forty-four	on	a	plant-based	diet
speaks	to	this	sort	of	untapped	reservoir	of	potential	that	I	think	we’re	all
sitting	on	top	of,	because	I	don’t	consider	myself	to	be	anything	special.
And	that	feat	is	really	just	a	metaphor	for	the	sorts	of	things	that	we	all
overlook	in	our	own	lives	that	perhaps	we	should	pay	more	attention	to.
In	 September	 2017,	 Rich	 completed	 the	 ÖTILLÖ	 Swimrun
World	 Championship,	 considered	 one	 of	 the	 most	 difficult
endurance	 events	in	 the	 world.	 During	 the	 ÖTILLÖ,	 which
means	“island	to	island”	in	Swedish,	competitors	swim	and	run
forty-six	 miles	 across	twenty-six	 islands	 in	 the	 Stockholm
Archipelago.	It	took	Rich	and	his	teammate	almost	eleven	hours
to	finish,	three	hours	behind	the	winning	team.	In	an	interview
with	the	New	York	Times,	he	confessed	the	race	was	the	hardest
thing	he	had	ever	done.	But	he	also	added	that	the	experience
validated	 one	 of	 the	 important	messages	 he	 frequently	 shares
with	his	followers:	“The	main	thing	is	realizing	that	even	if	you
feel	terrible	for	a	while,	that’s	not	how	you’re	going	to	feel	the
whole	time.	.	.	.	Things	change	if	you	just	keep	moving.”

What’s	Stopping	You?
Align	all	eight	of	the	essentials—intent,	authenticity,	passion,	patience,	speed,
work	ethic,	ability	to	track	consumer	attention	and	master	social	platforms,	and
content—and	you	have	the	closest	thing	to	a	formula	for	crushing	it	that	I	can
offer.	Yet	I	know	that	even	a	so-called	formula	won’t	be	enough	to	get	some	of
you	into	do	mode.	Every	day	I	meet	people	who	swear	they	are	going	to	start
their	own	“thing.”	Most	won’t.	I	asked	my	team	to	give	me	a	list	of	the	most
common	reasons	they’ve	heard,	whether	in	the	comments	sections	of	our	content
or	in	their	interactions	with	other	aspiring	entrepreneurs,	for	failing	to	crush	it.
Here’s	what	they	came	up	with:
I	have	a	full-time	job.
I	don’t	have	any	money.
I	have	kids.
I	don’t	have	time.
My	industry	has	too	many	strict	rules.
I	have	an	idea	for	an	app,	but	I	don’t	know	how	to	code.
My	parents	don’t	get	it.
My	family	is	holding	me	back.
I’m	afraid	my	friends	will	get	ahead	of	me.
I	still	haven’t	finished	the	books	assigned	by	my	life	coach.

No	one	was	watching.
Only	a	few	people	were	reading.
I	don’t	know	which	idea	to	pursue.
I	don’t	have	the	right	equipment.
I	don’t	know	where	to	start.
I’m	too	old.
I’m	an	artist,	not	a	businessperson.
I’m	not	into	anything	monetizable.
I’m	afraid	I’ll	get	hate	comments.
Every	one	of	these	is	bullshit,	and	some	belong	in	the	category	of	“Are	you
fucking	 kidding	 me?”	 Of	 the	 hundred	 or	 so	 finalists	we	 considered	 before
winnowing	the	list	of	Crushing	It!	contributors	down	to	the	ones	we	included	in
this	book,	only	a	handful	were	bringing	in	more	than	a	moderate	income	at	the
time	 they	 decided	 to	 go	 all	 in	 and	 crush	 it.	 Many	 were	 flat	 broke	 or	 barely
making	ends	meet.	Several	had	young	children,	and	others	were	old	enough	to
be	 grandparents.	 A	 number	 had	 already	 failed	 at	 previous	 attempts	 to	 build
businesses.	At	least	three	had	served	jail	time.	You	can	write	these	examples	off
as	anecdotal,	but	remember,	we	received	so	many	responses	that	we	couldn’t
possibly	include	them	all.	If	hundreds	of	thousands	of	people	can	figure	out	a
way	to	crush	it,	isn’t	it	possible	that	you	could,	too?	Isn’t	it	at	least	worth	a	try?
About	the	hate	mail.	Yes,	there	are	hateful	people	out	there	who	are	pissed	off
because	they’re	not	doing	shit,	and	you	will	likely	hear	from	them,	especially,	as
photographer	Jared	Polin	points	out,	if	you	succeed.	Don’t	let	them	keep	you
quiet,	or	as	Polin	also	says,	“Fuck	the	naysayers.”	Sometimes	it	can	be	hard,	and
some	people	will	get	more	hurtful	or	inappropriate	feedback	than	others.	Women
will	have	a	different	experience	on	social	media	than	most	men	will.	Surely	you
already	know	that	many,	many	dudes	are	scum	buckets.	Then	there	are	the	run-
of-the-mill	 insults	 that	 can	 come	 from	 anyone:	 You’re	 ugly.	 You’re	stupid.
You’re	not	all	that.	Want	to	know	how	the	best	influencers	handle	that	crap?
They	ignore	it	or	they	confront	it.	In	fact,	you	probably	haven’t	made	it	big	until
you’ve	read	aloud	your	hate	mail	in	a	post.	Hell,	Taylor	Swift	wrote	a	number-
one	song	about	it.	Misogyny,	racism,	and	bigotry	are	very	real	problems,	but
they	are	not	the	reason	why	you’re	not	crushing	it	yet.	You	are	the	reason	why
you’re	not	crushing	it	yet.	For	real,	when	the	haters	come	at	you,	just	shake	it	the
fuck	off.	You	know	they’re	not	crushing	it	because	they’ve	got	time	to	waste

spewing	poison	at	you.	You	should	pity	them.	If	you	really	want	to	show	what
you’re	 made	 of,	 transform	 their	 ignorance	into	 phenomenal	 content	 for	 your
fans.
Social	media	and	technology	haven’t	made	the	world	any	worse	than	it	was
before.	They	don’t	change	us;	they	expose	us.	And	that’s	not	a	bad	thing.	We’re
always	more	effective	against	the	demons	we	know	and	can	identify	than	the
ones	 hiding	 in	 the	dark.	All	 the	 reasons	people	 throw	 out	 to	 justify	 why
they’re	not	doing	what	they	say	they	want	to	do	boil	down	to	one	of	three
kinds	of	fear,	each	of	which	requires	a	different	response.
Fear	of	Failure
Well,	that’s	what	people	say	they’re	afraid	of,	anyway.	I	think	what	they’re	really
afraid	of	is	being	judged	by	people	whose	opinions	mean	something	to	them.
I’m	not	going	to	minimize	this.	I	know	it	well.	I	don’t	give	a	crap	what	people
think,	and	yet	there	are	days	when	I	will	go	to	ridiculous	lengths	to	turn	around
someone’s	negative	opinion	of	me	because	I	care	equally	what	everybody	thinks
about	me.	 Believe	 me,	 I	 get	 it,	 especially	 if	 you’re	 worried	 about	 justifying
yourself	to	your	family.	I	have	the	most	supportive	family	in	the	world,	and	even
I	occasionally	get	razzed	when	one	of	my	investments	fails	or	something	doesn’t
go	the	way	I	predict	it	will.	So	I	can	totally	understand	how	devastating	it	would
be	 to	 learn	 that	 you’ve	 disappointed	 your	 mom,	 earned	the	 scorn	 of	 your
siblings,	or	been	dismissed	by	your	closest	friends.	But	you	are	just	going	to
have	 to	 find	 a	 way	 to	 get	over	it.	 Get	 a	 shrink,	 start	 practicing	 yoga,	 find	 a
hypnotist,	do	whatever	it	takes	to	settle	your	nerves,	embrace	the	moment,	and
stop	caring	what	other	people	think.	Commit	to	ignoring	every	single	voice	that
threatens	to	undermine	you.	If	it’s	your	mom,	find	a	respectful	way	to	tell	her
you	want	her	love	but	not	her	opinion.	If	it’s	your	friends,	tell	them	you	are
grateful	for	their	concern	but	they	have	to	choose	to	support	you	or	fuck	off.	The
only	person	you	can’t	ignore	is	your	spouse	if	you	have	one.	The	way	around
that	is	to	work	with	your	husband	or	wife	to	come	up	with	a	plan	that	you	can
both	live	with.	There	will	always	be	people	around	you	to	tell	you	not	to	do
things.	You	have	to	let	yourself	be	your	sole	judge	and	jury.
In	my	experience,	good	communication	solves	all	things.	I	advise	everyone	in
this	predicament	to	confront	the	problem	head-on.	Sit	down	with	the	people	you
care	most	about	and	say,	“I	am	going	to	do	something	I	should	have	done	ages

ago.	The	only	thing	that	stopped	me	was	my	fear	of	what	you’d	say,	but	you
need	to	know	that	I’m	over	that	now.	I	don’t	need	your	blessing,	but	I	do	need	to
know	that	I	will	have	your	support	when	I	fail.	Because	I	will.	Not	spectacularly,
I	hope,	but	definitely	in	the	short	term.	In	the	long	term,	though,	I’m	going	to
win,	and	it	would	mean	the	world	to	me	to	know	you’ve	got	my	back	and	are
hoping	for	my	success,	not	waiting	for	my	failure.”
Then,	no	matter	how	they	respond,	start.	Just	like	that.	You’ll	be	amazed	how
quickly	you	can	work	when	you’re	no	longer	tethered	by	the	tyranny	of	other
people’s	opinions.	People	who	are	afraid	to	fail	will	always	set	their	goals	far
lower	than	they	need	to,	much	to	the	delight	of	their	competitors.
No	one	who	played	it	safe	ever	made	it	big.	This	is	your	life,	and	I	promise
you	the	chances	of	truly	ruining	it	are	slim.	Short	of	self-destructive	behavior	or
a	complete	lack	of	self-awareness,	there	is	very,	very	little	you	can	do	that	you
cannot	recover	from.	Be	clear-eyed	and	strategic,	be	willing	to	work	harder	and
longer	than	you	ever	have	in	your	life,	and	you	won’t	disappoint	anyone.	In	fact,
I	predict	you’ll	surprise	everyone.
How	I’m	Crushing	It
Rodrigo	Tasca,	Tasca	Studios
IG:	drigo_who
Rodrigo	Tasca	is	not	leading	the	glamorous	life.	The	thirty-
one-year-old	moved	back	into	his	parents’	house	in	Florida	to
save	on	rent.	He	hired	his	sister	to	help	with	his	videography
business,	 and	 his	 studio	 was	 his	 bedroom.	 It’s	 a	 far	 cry	 from
when	he	used	to	live	in	New	York,	where	he	was	photographing
models	 and	 shooting	 behind-the-scenes	 videos	 for	 magazines.
Yet,	he	still	thinks	he’s	got	it	better	than	some	of	his	friends.	In
fact,	he	feels	sorry	for	them.
“Moving	back	to	Florida	was	a	risk,	but	I	knew	that	I	had	to
get	out	of	my	comfort	zone.	.	.	.	I	wasn’t	getting	any	younger.
But	I	was	willing	to	start	back	at	zero	and	put	in	the	work.	I
wake	up	every	day	and	I’m	happy	with	what	I’m	doing.	But	then
I’m	hanging	out	with	some	friends	and	they’re	just	like,	‘God,	I

hate	what	I’m	doing.’	Dude,	there’s	no	reason	why	[you	should
be]	doing	something	that	you	hate	nowadays.	But	they’re	afraid
to	fail,	or	they’re	afraid	about	what	their	image	will	look	like.”
He	gets	it.	It’s	hard	to	impress	women	when	you	tell	them	that
you’re	 living	 with	 your	 parents.	 “I’m	 thirty-one	 years	 old,
definitely	feel	like	I	want	to	settle	down	more.	But	if	I	meet	a
girl	nowadays,	there	has	to	be	an	understanding.	I’m	trying	to
create	something	bigger	here,	and	I	need	to	make	this	sacrifice
for	the	next	year-and-a-half	of	my	life	so	I	can	have	a	better	life,
and	a	potentially	better	life	for	us	within	the	next	five	years.	If
you’re	not	cool	with	that,	you’re	not	the	girl	I’m	looking	for.”
Rodrigo	started	out	in	the	restaurant	business,	first	with	his
family,	later	working	for	a	large	corporation.	About	seven	years
ago,	 he	 won	 a	 GoPro	 at	 a	 company	 holiday	 party	 raffle.	 He
loved	 playing	 around	 with	 it	 and	 making	 videos	 but	 had	 no
intention	of	doing	anything	else	with	it	until	he	visited	a	friend
of	his	living	in	Peru.	The	friend	was	a	real	estate	agent,	and	one
day,	when	his	photographer	didn’t	show	up,	he	asked	if	Rodrigo
could	take	the	pictures	instead.	He	agreed	but	then	offered	 to
take	some	videos	of	the	property,	too.	He	spent	the	next	seven
months	filming	and	renting	real	estate	properties	in	Peru.
Upon	his	return	to	the	United	States,	he	moved	to	New	York
for	a	short-lived	position	at	one	of	his	previous	employer’s	new
restaurants,	 then	 paid	 the	 bills	 by	 working	 at	 a	 tennis	 club,
where	he	landed	his	next	job	as	a	personal	chef	for	a	family	in
the	Hamptons,	while	also	freelancing	with	a	catering	company.
He	 discovered	Crush	 It!	 when	 his	 company	 cooked	 for
Techweek	2015	and	he	heard	this	Belarusian	immigrant	tell	the
story	of	how	he	made	money	as	a	New	Jersey	teenager	buying
Shaq	dolls	at	the	dollar	store	and	returning	them	to	Kmart	across
the	street	for	a	full	refund.	This	kind	of	hustle	was	familiar	to
Rodrigo,	 whose	 family	 had	 moved	 to	 the	 States	 from	 Brazil
when	 he	 was	 a	 small	 child.	 Money	was	 tight,	 so	 when	 his
parents	would	go	to	Costco	to	buy	supplies	for	the	restaurant,
he’d	buy	a	box	of	candy	bars	for	six	or	seven	bucks	and	sell
them	to	his	classmates	at	school	for	a	dollar	each.
He’d	 listen	 to	Crush	 It!	during	 his	 hour-long	 subway
commute	from	his	apartment	in	Crown	Heights	to	cook	for	his
clients’	family	on	the	Upper	East	Side,	and	it	convinced	him	to

follow	his	passion	and	start	filming.	Film	school	was	financially
out	of	the	question;	he	was	going	to	have	to	learn	on	the	job.	He
started	with	his	roommates,	who	were	models,	and	then	offered
to	do	a	shoot	for	a	clothing	company	where	one	of	his	friends
worked.	They	put	the	shoot	up	on	their	Instagram,	and	it	got	so
much	attention	that	they	invited	him	to	shoot	another	event.	He
earned	a	little	money	for	that	gig,	but	it	would	be	the	only	one
that	paid	out	of	the	next	ten	or	so	videos	he’d	create.	And	that
was	by	design.	While	taking	so	many	online	Udemy	classes	that
the	company	contacted	him	to	find	out	why	he	was	consuming
so	much	content	so	fast,	he	was	offering	his	services	for	free	to
anyone	 he	 could	 find.	“I’d	 find	 someone	 who	 was	 having	 an
event,	and	say,	‘Hey,	is	somebody	shooting	for	you?’	And	if	they
said	no,	I’d	offer	myself	up.	It	was	pretty	much,	what	can	I	do	to
get	my	foot	in	the	door?	I	didn’t	have	the	technical	skills,	but	I
figured	going	out	and	learning	and	getting	the	field	experience
and	the	opportunity	to	work	with	clients	was	going	to	benefit	me
in	the	long	run,	so	when	I	was	ready	to	charge	somebody,	all
those	 skills	 from	 the	 free	 stuff	 I	 was	 doing	 would	 come	 into
play.”
He	had	the	perfect	day	job	to	accommodate	his	training.	The
family	he	worked	for	in	the	Hamptons	and	the	Upper	East	Side
would	have	him	work	about	forty	hours	over	two	or	three	days,
which	left	the	rest	of	the	week	open	for	him	to	work	on	his	craft.
“You	have	to	start	building	those	connections.	That’s	what	drove
me.	At	first	it	could	be	discouraging,	but	Rome	wasn’t	built	in	a
day.”
After	about	three	months,	he	finally	got	paid	$200	to	film	a
behind-the-scenes	 video	 for	 a	 large	 publication.	 Eager	 to	 get
away	 from	 the	 New	 York	 winters,	 he	 started	 researching	 the
Florida	 market	 for	 those	 types	 of	 videos	 and	 discovered	 that
there	was	 a	 void.	 No	 one	 was	 doing	 that	 kind	 of	 work	 down
there.	He	decided	he	would	be	the	one	to	create	a	market	for	it.
So	Rodrigo	moved	back	to	Florida	in	March	2016.	Things	did
not	go	well.
In	New	York,	I	would	find	a	client	and	then	do	the	whole	project	for
them,	 the	 whole	 process,	 shooting	 a	 video,	 editing,	 and	producing.	 I
thought	I	was	going	to	come	back	to	Florida	and	be	this	hotshot	from
New	York,	and	then	I	realized	that	no	one	cares	that	I	was	in	New	York.

It’s	one	of	those	things;	I	needed	to	wake	up	and	realize	that	the	other
thing	I	learned	about	from	Crush	It!	is	growing	a	personal	brand.	At	first,
I	was	like,	“Hey,	I’m	Rodrigo	Tasca	from	Rodrigo	Tasca	Productions.”
And	everyone	is	like,	“Who?”	And	pretty	much	I	got	a	lot	of	doors	shut
on	me.	But	then	I	changed	my	brand	to	Tasca	Studios,	and	then	people
were	willing	to	set	up	an	appointment	to	meet	with	me	and	hear	what	I
had	to	say,	and	learn	that	there	was	a	market	for	small-business	videos
versus	behind-the-scenes	for	magazines.	So	changing	that	brand	was	like
adjusting	to	the	market,	realizing	that	people	didn’t	want	to	hire	just	one
guy	who	does	it	all,	unlike	New	York,	where	if	you’re	not	the	one	guy
who	does	it	all,	they’re	going	to	find	someone	else.	There	are	still	clients
here	who	have	only	recently	started	a	Facebook	page.
Rodrigo	 is	 committed	 to	 helping	 his	 clients	 learn	 how	 to
market	online,	teaching	them	the	basics	of	Facebook,	Instagram,
and	YouTube	 marketing,	 even	 when	 they	 resist	 at	 first.	 His
persistence	and	commitment	have	paid	off.
A	year	ago,	when	I	started,	we	were	calling	businesses	and	offering	free
videos,	 and	 people	 were	 like,	 “No,	 we’re	 not	 interested,”	or	“No,	we
don’t	need	it.”	Compare	that	to	the	fact	that	I	now	charge	clients	twelve
hundred	dollars	for	the	day	to	shoot.	I’m	going	to	California.	I	just	got
back	from	Tennessee	after	shooting	at	a	music	festival.	It’s	just	so	crazy
that	within	one	year	of	hard	work	and	hustle—where	that	has	led	me.
I	could	move	out,	but	I’m	considering	staying	at	my	parents’	house	for
another	 year	 and	 then	 getting	 an	 office	 space.	 My	 family	is	 super
supportive	about	what	my	sister	and	I	are	doing	(she	left	her	job	and
works	with	me	full-time	now).	They’re	like,	“Whatever	we	can	do	to
help.	We	wanna	see	this	work	out	for	you	guys.”	I	really	wouldn’t	have
made	it	this	far	without	the	support	of	my	friends	and	family.
Fear	of	Wasting	Time
If	you’re	under	the	age	of	thirty-five,	this	isn’t	even	an	issue.	You	can	always	go
back	 to	 the	 practical	 world	 in	 twenty-four	months	 if	 you	 stink	 or	 hate	 what
you’re	doing.	School	and	the	nine-to-five	grind	are	not	going	anywhere.
It	bears	mentioning	that	a	fear	of	wasting	time	has	also	caused	many	more-
established	 entrepreneurs	 to	 miss	 important	 opportunities.	There	 are	 a	 lot	 of
people	 who	 ceded	 ground	 on	 Instagram	 because	 they	 were	 putting	 all	 their
energy	into	Twitter	and	Facebook.	The	people	who	laughed	at	Snapchat	should
feel	pretty	foolish	now.	Every	platform	is	worth	some	investment.	Of	course	not
every	one	will	feel	like	a	good	fit,	and	not	every	platform	will	pay	off,	but	you

can’t	know	until	you	spend	some	time	there.	For	every	Snapchat	and	Insta	where
I	 won,	 there	 was	 a	 Socialcam	 where	 I	 lost.	 I	 can	 assure	 you	 that	 whatever	 I
learned	on	Socialcam	made	me	a	hell	of	a	better	player	everywhere	else.
People	are	so	scared	they’ll	be	wasting	time	if	they	try	to	build	a	business,
even	when	their	time	isn’t	valuable.	If	you’re	sacrificing	time	you	could	have
spent	with	loved	ones	or	doing	something	that	brings	value	to	your	life—or	hell,
$50K—then	 I	 can	 see	 how	 that	 might	 cause	 you	 some	 regrets.	 But	 if	 you’re
giving	 up	 only	 your	 downtime—time	 you	 would	 have	otherwise	 spent	 with
Game	of	Thrones	or	some	video	games—how	can	you	say	it	was	wasted?	You’re
literally	giving	up	empty	hours	in	favor	of	doing	something	that	could	fill	your
life	with	joy,	and	you’re	worried	about	wasting	time?	That’s	bullshit.	If	you’re
not	100	percent	happy	with	your	life	today,	it	is	never	a	waste	of	time	to	try
something	that	could	get	you	there.
How	I’m	Crushing	It
Sean	O’Shea,	The	Good	Dog
IG:	@thegooddogtraining
When	you’re	young	and	your	biggest	dream	is	to	become	a
professional	musician,	you	accept	that	you’ll	be	working	low-
prestige,	highly	flexible	jobs,	like	bartending	and	waiting	tables,
to	keep	you	financially	afloat	until	you	make	it.	It	goes	with	the
territory.	Everyone’s	got	to	pay	their	dues.	At	twenty-five,	even
at	thirty,	you’re	cool	with	it.
At	forty,	not	so	much.
For	eleven	years,	Sean	O’Shea	worked	as	a	valet,	parking	cars
at	 a	 restaurant	 as	 well	 as	 for	 a	 company	 that	 handled	 private
events	for	Beverly	Hills	celebrities.	A	drummer	since	the	age	of
three,	he’d	played	on	hit	records	with	artists	like	Alicia	Keys,
CeeLo	Green,	Jennifer	Hudson,	and	Ghostface	Killah.	Despite
being	a	part	of	some	hit	tracks,	it	was	the	valet	work	that	was
paying	 the	 bills,	 not	 the	 music.	 The	 future	 was	 not	 looking
bright,	and	he	was	in	“a	bad	space.”
His	 break	 came	 in	 the	 form	 of	 two	 demented	 dogs.	 Both
pound	 puppies,	 at	 six	 months	 the	 Chow	 mix,	 Junior,	 and	 pit-

Rhodesian,	Oakley,	 were	 sweet	 and	 cute	 and	 everything	 you
want	in	a	puppy.	But	like	a	lot	of	dog	owners,	Sean	didn’t	really
know	 what	he	 was	 getting	 into.	 Puppies	 require	 a	 lot	 of
consistent	 training	 and	 discipline,	 and	 Sean	 admits	 he	 did
everything	wrong.	At	first	the	dogs	were	just	obnoxious	and	ill-
mannered,	but	by	the	time	they	turned	two-and-a-half,	they	were
dangerously	aggressive	 and	 reactive	 toward	 other	 dogs.	 “We
were	a	menace	to	the	neighborhood.	They	were	huge,	and	if	we
were	at	the	park	and	the	grass	was	wet	and	they	saw	another
dog,	they	would	literally	take	off	and	pull	me	on	my	ass,	like	I
was	 waterskiing,	except	 on	 my	 rear	 across	 the	 park.	 I	 even
ended	up	on	Judge	Judy	because	my	dog	had	gone	after	another
person’s	dog.”
He	didn’t	blame	the	dogs;	he	knew	the	failure	was	his.	And	he
knew	 that	 if	 he	 was	 going	 to	 keep	 these	 animals	 and	 protect
them,	he	was	going	to	have	to	figure	out	a	way	to	turn	things
around.	He	started	watching	Dog	Whisperer	with	Cesar	Millan
and	 studying	 dog-training	 techniques.	 He	 also	 started	 doing
some	deep	personal	development	work.
“To	be	honest,	I	was	a	pretty	good	mess.	I	studied	my	ass	off.
Not	traditional	books,	but	a	lot	of	personal	work	to	change	my
belief	 system,	 change	 my	 values,	 work	 on	 character,	 work	 on
everything	that	I	had	never	really	received	as	a	kid	or	as	a	young
adult.”
It	took	a	few	years,	but	eventually	his	methods—known	as
“balanced	training”	technique—turned	his	dogs	into	models	of
good	behavior,	much	to	the	surprise	and	relief	of	the	neighbors.
The	transformation	was	so	remarkable	that	around	2006	he	was
able	to	  start	  a	  neighborhood	  dog-walking	  business,
supplementing	his	income	as	a	valet	and	part-time	musician.	He
became	the	guy	who	could	take	a	giant	pack	of	fourteen	dogs
out	at	one	time	and	make	it	look	easy.	Naturally,	people	started
asking	 him	 if	he	 could	 train	 their	 dogs,	 too.	 As	 a	 valet	 and
musician,	 he’d	 brought	 in	 about	 $20K.	 In	 his	 first	 year	 of
training	and	walking,	he	brought	in	$65K.	That	figure	doubled
the	second	year.
Sean	 started	 to	 feel	 a	 new	 dream	 coalesce,	 one	 that	 didn’t
include	going	on	tour	with	a	band.	Yet	while	he	had	discovered	a
natural	ability	to	communicate	with	dogs,	he	was	not	a	natural

businessperson.	“I	didn’t	know	anything	about	business.	Zero.
Like	 the	 word	brand,	 the	 word	marketing—I	 didn’t	 know
anything	about	any	of	that	stuff.”	He	read	obsessively	to	educate
himself,	 however,	 which	 is	 how	 he	 came	 upon	Crush	It!	 He
followed	every	word.
“I	 dove	 in	 pretty	 naïvely,	 started	 creating	 a	 ton	 of	 videos,
starting	 doing	 a	 ton	 of	 Facebook.	 I	 remember	 simple
conversations	with	myself:	If	I	was	the	consumer	out	there,	what
would	cause	me	to	come	back	to	a	Facebook	page	or	a	YouTube
channel	 over	 and	 over	 again?	And	 the	 only	 answer	 I	 could
come	up	with	was	if	it	helped	improve	my	life,	if	it	had	value	in
that	sense.	And	that	was	my	guiding	light.”
Even	 though	 he	 wasn’t	 comfortable	 on	 camera,	 he	 started
filming	videos	with	a	cheap	flip	cam.	“Do-it-yourself	videos,	a
ton	of	teaching	videos,	a	ton	of	before-and-after	videos,	a	ton	of
showing	what	we	could	do,	but	also	teaching	people	how	they
could	do	their	own	thing.”	Other	trainers	were	doing	the	same,
but	 his	 intense	 efforts	 and	 the	 fact	 that	 he	 was	 early	 to	 the
platforms,	served	to	differentiate	him	and	elevate	his	profile.
A	lot	of	trainers	at	the	time,	whether	in	social	media	or	otherwise,	were
in	a	kind	of	chest-beating	space,	like,	“I’ve	come	out	of	the	womb	and	I
instantly	 was	 gifted	 with	 this	 thing.”	 My	 journey	 was	 more	 like,	 “I
fucked	everything	up,	and	I	was	a	wreck,	and	my	dogs	were	a	wreck.
Here’s	my	journey	of	how	I	got	out	of	there.	Let	me	share	that	with	you
guys.”	I	was	really	transparent	and	doing	my	very	best	to	try	to	share	the
information,	 the	 tools,	 the	 approach,	 the	 techniques,	 and	 my	 own
blueprint	for	how	I	got	out,	including	personal-development	 stuff	 and
recommended	books.
I	 worked	 obsessively.	 I	 studied,	 studied,	 studied,	 studied,	 trying	 to
understand	how	to	do	this	right	and	how	to	build	this,	because	I	was	so
obsessed	 with	 doing	 something	 special.	 I	 finally	 felt	 like	 I	 found	 my
break.	 My	 biggest	 goal	 was	 to	 do	 something	that	 had	 an	 impact.	 It
sounds	cheesy,	but	that	was	really	where	I	was	at.	I	think	I	struggled	for
so	long	not	feeling	that	way	that	when	I	found	the	opportunity,	I	just
went	 kit	 and	 caboodle	 all	 the	 way	 in.	 I	 was	 determined	 to	 find	 my
answer,	 determined	to	 develop,	 cultivate	 the	 skills	 so	 I	 could	 move
forward.	And	I	knew	I	had	a	shit	ton	of	catching	up	to	do.	I	was	so	far
behind.
His	 following	 grew	 quickly.	 He	 waited	 until	 he	 was
“overflowing”	 with	 clients	 before	 quitting	 the	 valet	 gig.	 “I’d
been	there	eleven	years,	and	everyone	was	like,	‘Where	do	you
think	you’re	going?’	And	I	was	like,	‘We	got	plans.’”

Within	a	few	years,	he	had	built	an	international	profile	(he
called	 in	 from	 Scotland	 for	 an	 interview	 for	 this	 book,	 after
speaking	 in	 front	 of	 the	 Scottish	 Parliament	 about	 balanced
training	and	his	ideas	for	regulating	the	industry).	In	2012,	he
opened	a	second	location	in	New	Orleans.	He	hired	a	partner,
Laura,	who	had	worked	with	some	big	names	in	Hollywood	and
could	provide	the	administrative	and	organizational	support	he
needed,	and	more	trainers	to	handle	the	increased	demand	for
his	services.
Now	forty-nine,	Sean	does	very	little	training	himself,	except
when	especially	dangerous	animals	come	in,	which	he	takes	on
until	they’re	safe	for	his	team	to	work	with.	People	fly	their	dogs
in	from	all	over	the	country.	And	trainers	travel	from	all	over	the
world	to	study	with	Sean	and	his	team,	learning	not	just	training
techniques	but	how	to	leverage	social	media	for	their	businesses.
He	spends	about	six	hours	a	day	creating	content	and	responding
to	his	community.	He’s	also	written	a	book	and	created	DVDs,
and	he	runs	a	Q&A	podcast.	“There	are	so	many	people	around
the	world	who	can’t	get	to	us	and	can’t	get	to	other	trainers	for
help	with	serious	stuff.	We’re	trying	to	empower	people.	We	get
feedback	from	people	in	different	countries,	and	they’re	sending
pictures	of	their	dogs	off	leash,	fully	trained,	just	by	using	our
free	videos.	It’s	really	awesome.”
One	thing	he	hasn’t	done	is	product	placements.	“I	don’t	want
to	 cheapen	 the	 blog.	 Not	 that	 [I	 wouldn’t	 do	 it]	 if	 something
amazing	came	along.	And	I	don’t	mean	monetarily,	necessarily.
Money	would	be	great,	but	there	are	so	many	cheesy	products
from	people	who	don’t	even	build	relationships.	They	just	send
you	an	e-mail	and	they’re	like,	‘Hey,	would	you	put	this	in	your
blog?’	 No!”	 He	 has	 built	 the	 entire	 business	 through	 social
media	and	his	personal	brand.	In	2016,	he	grossed	more	than
$600k.
Not	 a	 moment	 goes	 by	 when	 he’s	 not	 thinking	 about	 the
business.
I	have	a	little	bit	of	downtime,	but	with	Instagram	Stories	and	Instagram
and	Facebook	and	YouTube	and	responding	and	training	and	running	the
business,	there’s	not	a	whole	lot	of	extra	time,	but	that’s	cool	for	right
now.	 It’s	 what’s	 needed	 in	 order	to	 get	 things	 to	 the	 right	 space.	 I’m
totally	down	for	it.	To	be	honest,	being	forty	years	old	[when	I	started],	I

don’t	 feel	I	 have	 time	 to	 waste.	 It’s	 not	 a	 desperate	 thing.	 It’s	 not	 a
freaked-out	or	panicky	thing.	It’s	just,	“You	don’t	have	time,	buddy.	You
wasted	a	lot	of	time	doing	a	lot	of	stuff	that	didn’t	serve	you.	Let’s	go
hard	and	see	what	you	can	make	happen	in	the	time	you’ve	got.”
Fear	of	Seeming	Vain
When	I	wrote	Crush	It!	in	2009,	I	got	a	good	amount	of	grief	from	critics	who
accused	 me	 of	 glorifying	 narcissism.	 I	 don’t	 hear	 much	 from	 them	 anymore,
because	I’ve	been	proven	right	by	the	consumer,	aka	the	market:	developing	a
strong	 personal	 brand	 leads	 to	 business	 success.	Don’t	 worry	 about	 seeming
vain.	 Embrace	 it.	 Everybody	 else	 who	 is	 crushing	 it	 did.	 Remember,	 smart
entrepreneurs	don’t	care	what	other	people	think.	You’ll	look	like	an	ass	for	a
while	if	you	walk	around	with	a	camera	constantly	pointed	at	your	face,	but
everyone	looks	like	an	ass	when	trying	something	new.	Reality	TV	was	once	a
joke,	remember?	Now	you	can’t	turn	around	without	seeing	a	reality	star	on	a
magazine	cover,	a	makeup	counter,	some	exercise	equipment,	or	a	frozen-food
package.	Everyone’s	an	ass	until	they’re	a	pioneer.
Set	Your	Mind	to	Success
The	most	exciting	part	about	being	an	entrepreneur	today	is	that	we’re	still	living
in	the	early	years.	The	pool	is	crowded,	but	there	is	still	plenty	of	room	for	you.
Get	in	while	you	can!	Look,	I’m	sympathetic.	I	didn’t	learn	how	to	swim	until	I
was	nine	years	old	because	I	was	too	scared	to	put	my	face	in	the	water.	The
only	reason	I	finally	learned	was	that	one	day	I	was	playing	air	hockey	at	the
community	 pool	 when	 I	 heard	 my	 mom	 clapping	 and	 cheering.	 My	 younger
sister	had	just	figured	out	how	to	do	the	crawl	stroke	and	was	making	her	way
across	the	pool.	I	ripped	off	my	shirt,	threw	myself	into	the	pool,	and	started
swimming	before	my	mom’s	applause	stopped	echoing.	There	was	no	way	my
sister	was	going	to	learn	to	swim	before	me.
Sometimes	you	just	have	to	jump	into	the	pool,	even	when	you’re	scared.
As	you	gather	your	ideas	and	put	your	strategies	in	motion,	set	yourself	up
emotionally	to	succeed.	Find	your	courage	and	strengthen	your	self-esteem	until
you	feel	brave	enough	to	make	some	noise	and	invite	people’s	attention.	Then

show	them	that	you	care	deeply	about	keeping	it.
Several	 of	 the	 people	 interviewed	 for	 this	 book	 said	 that,	 while	 hugely
inspiring,	Crush	It!	didn’t	actually	compel	them	to	change	anything	about	how
they	were	growing	their	personal	brand	or	running	their	business,	because	they
couldn’t	imagine	operating	any	other	way.	Caring	about	quality,	value,	and	the
customer	experience	above	and	beyond	anything	else	was	already	working	for
them.	 We	 live	 in	 such	 a	 fast,	 casual,	 cynical	 world	 that	 it	 can	 be	 almost
disorienting	to	 customers	 when	 they	 come	 into	 contact	 with	 someone	 whose
eagerness	to	help	or	please	bowls	them	over	like	an	enthusiastic	Saint	Bernard.
Disorienting	but	also	delightful.	And	addictive.	Crush	It!	merely	confirmed	what
these	stellar	entrepreneurs	already	felt	deep	in	their	hearts,	and	it	gave	them	the
satisfaction	of	knowing	they	were	right	to	follow	their	instincts.
It’s	very	Wizard	of	Oz,	actually.	Let	me	get	a	little	Glinda	the	Good	Witch	on
you:	You’ve	always	had	the	power	to	achieve	your	wildest	ambitions.	There	is
literally—literally—no	 reason	 why	 you	 can’t	 become	 an	 entrepreneur	 and
influencer	in	2018.	It’s	my	greatest	hope	that	by	the	end	of	this	book,	you’ll	feel
a	lot	like	nine-year-old	me	as	I	hurled	myself	into	the	deep	end	of	the	pool	and
realized,	“Oh,	I	can	fucking	swim!”
How	I’m	Crushing	It
Mimi	Goodwin,	Mimi	G	Style
IG:	@mimigstyle
The	 school	 of	 hard	 knocks	 is	 a	 brutal	 place	 to	 get	 your
formative	 education.	 Mimi	 Goodwin	 should	 know.	 Raised	 in
Chicago	by	a	single	mother	who	worked	two	full-time	jobs	to
make	 ends	 meet,	 she	 often	 spent	 time	 at	 her	 grandparents’
house,	 where	 she	was	 molested	 at	 a	 young	 age	 by	 two	 male
family	members.	When	her	mother	remarried,	Mimi	was	abused
by	 her	 stepfather.	 She	would	 find	 respite	 every	 summer	 in
Puerto	Rico,	where	she	went	to	spend	time	with	her	father.	Her
aunt	was	a	seamstress,	and	Mimi	loved	to	make	clothes	for	her
Barbies	while	sitting	next	to	her	as	she	sewed	ball	gowns	and
wedding	dresses.	Mimi’s	father	bought	her	a	sewing	machine,
and	 she	 took	 it	 back	 with	 her	 to	 Chicago,	 where	 her	 mother

would	buy	her	fabric.	When	she	was	thirteen,	Mimi	offered	to
make	 a	 dress	 for	 her	 mother	 to	 wear	 to	 a	 wedding.	 The	 end
result	was	horrible—the	dress’s	hemline	was	off	and	it	didn’t	fit
properly.	 Mimi’s	 mother	 wore	 it	 proudly	 anyway.	 Mimi	 was
thrilled,	and	a	seed	was	planted.
Unfortunately,	Mimi’s	home	life	became	intolerable	and	she
ran	 away,	 leaving	 the	 sewing	 machine	 behind.	 Seeking	 year-
round	warmth,	she	used	money	she’d	stolen	from	her	mother	to
buy	 a	 train	 ticket	 to	 California,	 where	 a	 friend	 of	 hers	 had
moved	with	 his	 family	 a	 month	 before.	 “I	 thought	 that	 all	 of
California	 was	 Hollywood.”	 She	 couldn’t	 understand	 the
conductor	 over	the	 loudspeaker.	 “I	 remember	 the	 conductor
saying	‘something,	something,	California,’	so	I	got	off	the	train.
And	it	ended	up	leaving	me	in	Pomona.	And	I	was	like,	‘This
doesn’t	look	anything	like	the	movies.’”
For	eight	or	nine	months,	she	lived	in	a	city	park,	sleeping	on
a	bench	or	with	random	people	in	exchange	for	money	or	food.
She	eventually	made	her	way	to	her	friend’s	house	and	moved
in.	 The	 friend	 became	 a	 boyfriend.	 She	 experienced	 domestic
violence	there,	too,	and	right	before	her	sixteenth	birthday,	she
found	out	she	was	pregnant.	Upon	hearing	she	was	going	to	be	a
grandmother,	Mimi’s	mother	came	to	visit	and	try	to	mend	the
rift	between	them.	“She	apologized,	and	I	apologized.	I	think	I
had	 a	 greater	understanding	 for	 my	 mom	 after	 I	 became	 a
parent;	I	found	myself	in	very	similar	predicaments.”
Eager	to	give	her	daughter,	Chastidy,	a	safer	living	situation,
Mimi	 moved	 out	 of	 the	 boyfriend’s	 house	 but	 wound	 up
squatting	in	an	abandoned	apartment	building	with	no	running
water.	Her	mother	begged	Mimi	to	let	her	take	the	baby	until
Mimi	could	get	her	life	together.	Reluctantly,	she	agreed.
Mimi	married	the	first	person	she	could,	so	she	could	get	a
house	and	bring	her	daughter	home.	Again	she	found	herself	in
an	 abusive	 relationship.	 A	 second	 daughter,	 Lexi,	 followed	 in
1998,	and	Mimi	tried	to	stick	it	out	with	her	husband,	but	when
Lexi	was	a	few	months	old,	Mimi	asked	some	married	friends	if
she	could	move	in	with	them.	She	had	a	job	as	a	receptionist	and
soon	 moved	 into	 her	 own	 one-bedroom	 apartment.	 She	 was
making	ends	meet,	but	barely.

There	were	weeks	where	we	would	have	a	lot	of	potatoes	or	a	lot	of	Top
Ramen	or	whatever	we	could	manage	at	that	time.	I	would	come	home
from	work,	go	right	into	the	bedroom,	close	the	door,	and	cry.	I	felt	I	was
drowning	 in	 whatever	 this	 life	 was.	And	 the	 kids	 would	 cry,	 “Mom!
Mom!	Mom!”	and	I’d	collect	myself	and	go	back	into	the	kitchen	and
make	dinner	and	move	on,	because	that’s	just	what	you	do	when	you’re	a
mom.
Things	 started	 looking	 up.	 She	 found	 a	 job	 working	 as	 a
receptionist	at	a	3-D	digital	media	company	for	a	man	named
Steve,	who	mentored	her	and	educated	her	about	his	business.
She	got	married	again	(“my	healthiest	relationship”),	had	two
more	children,	and	took	up	her	old	hobby,	sewing.	Her	husband
turned	the	garage	into	a	little	sewing	room	for	her.
She’d	wear	some	of	her	handmade	clothes	to	the	office	and
always	get	compliments.	Her	boss,	Steve,	who	was	always	the
first	one	 to	 scream	 across	 the	 room,	 “She	 made	 that!”	 would
often	sit	her	down	to	talk	about	her	ambitions	and	goals.	One
day,	when	they	were	having	this	conversation	and	he	was	asking
yet	again	what	she’d	 like	 to	 do	 besides	 be	 a	 receptionist,	 she
replied,	“I	think	I’d	like	to	be	a	fashion	designer.”
“How	much	would	you	need?”	he	asked.	They	talked	further
about	 what	 steps	 she	 would	 have	 to	 take	 to	 make	 her	 dream
come	true,	and	she	went	home.
The	next	day,	she	found	a	$30,000	check	on	her	desk.
She	started	working	on	a	collection	and	even	had	a	runway
show	at	the	Fashion	Business	Institute	in	Los	Angeles,	but	she
realized	soon	enough	that	while	she	loved	designing,	she	hated
the	 other	 aspects	 of	 the	 job.	 Steve	 didn’t	 get	 upset.	 “You’ll
figure	it	out,”	he	assured	her.
In	2012,	she	noticed	that	a	lot	of	people	were	starting	sewing
blogs	and	making	commercial	patterns	and	crafts	at	home.	She
thought,	I	 can	 do	 that,	 so	 in	 March	 she	 started	 her	 fashion
sewing	blog,	Mimi	G	Style.	At	the	time,	you	could	find	online
instructions	to	make	a	quilt	or	an	apron,	but	there	was	nowhere
to	go	where	you	could	find	out	how	to	make	the	clothes	you	saw
in	magazines.	“I	would	take	something	I	had	seen	on	the	runway
that	of	course	I	could	not	afford,	modify	it,	and	create	something
new.”
One	day	she	made	a	skirt	inspired	by	a	piece	she	had	seen
from	Oscar	de	la	Renta.	She	posted	it	on	the	blog,	and	people

went	nuts,	 begging	 her	 to	 make	 one	 for	 them.	 Mimi	 wasn’t
interested	in	sewing	for	hire,	so	she	posted	instructions	on	the
blog.	The	 requests	 persisted,	 however.	 Finally,	 around
Christmastime,	 when	 she	 was	 thinking	 about	 gifts	 for	 her
daughters,	she	thought,	What	if	I	just	take	a	couple	of	orders?	So
she	posted	that	she	would	take	orders	for	twenty-four	hours.	She
priced	the	skirt	high,	at	$198,	to	keep	the	number	of	orders	low.
And	she	warned	people	not	to	expect	to	get	their	skirt	for	four
weeks.	Then	she	went	to	bed.
When	she	woke	up	the	next	day,	she	had	thousands	of	dollars’
worth	of	orders.
She	 freaked	 out,	 sewed	 nonstop	 with	 her	 daughters	 cutting
and	 her	 husband	 folding	 next	 to	 her,	 delivered	 the	 skirts,	 and
swore,	“Never	 again.”	 Then	 she	 thought,	What	if	I	could	just
teach	them	to	make	it	themselves?
She	filmed	a	series	of	video	lessons,	showing	people	step-by-
step	how	to	create	a	garment	from	scratch	based	on	their	body
measurements.	 She	 created	 one	 new	 video	 per	 month,	 and
earnings	rose	so	fast	that	in	two	years	she	was	able	to	quit	her
job	and	 focus	 on	 growing	 her	 business.	 Meanwhile,	 “I	 was
getting	all	these	e-mails	from	everywhere	in	the	world,	from	all
these	women	saying,	‘I	came	across	your	blog	and	you	inspired
me	 to	 start	 a	 new	 hobby,’	 or	 ‘You’re	 inspiring	 me	 to	 dress
better,’	or	‘I	just	lost	my	job,’	‘I’m	going	through	a	divorce,’	‘I
was	thinking	of	committing	suicide,’	or	‘I’m	in	rehab,’	and	then
saying	 things	 like,	 ‘Somehow	 your	 blog	 has	 helped	 me	 get
through.’	At	that	moment,	I	realized	that	the	blog	was	less	about
fashion	and	sewing	and	really	was	a	vehicle	of	motivation.”
A	friend	who	loved	business	books	introduced	Mimi	to	Crush
It!	 in	 2015.	 By	 then,	 her	 blog	 was	 trucking	 along,	 she	 was
developing	her	own	products,	and	she	had	started	her	own	line
of	commercial	patterns.	She	was	already	using	and	loving	social
media,	but	reading	the	book	showed	her	that	there	was	still	more
she	could	do.	“OK,	you	turned	your	hobby	into	your	career,	it’s
your	 passion,	 you’re	 working	 hard,	 but	 now	 you	 need	 to	 do
more.	Now	you	need	to	engage	more.	Now	you	need	to	crank	up
your	customer	service.	Now	you	need	to	spend	time	asking	all
these	questions	and	making	sure	that	those	followers	and	those
fans	really	engage	and	become	loyal	to	you.	You	need	to	keep

building	that	community.”
For	example,	one	day	Mimi	posted	that	she	was	going	fabric
shopping,	and	someone	wrote	that	she	would	be	willing	to	fly	all
the	way	from	Tampa	to	go	fabric	shopping	with	her.	“I	thought
that	was	insane,	but	I	moved	the	date	by	thirty	days,	and	people
came!	And	at	the	end	of	the	day,	they	asked,	‘What	are	we	doing
next	year?’	Next	year?”
The	next	year,	she	booked	a	hotel,	set	up	some	classes,	and
about	 eighty	 people	 showed	 up.	 In	 2017,	 the	 Mimi	 G	 Style
Fashion	Sewing	 &	 Style	 Conference	 celebrated	 its	 sixth
anniversary.	It’s	followed	by	thousands	of	people	on	Facebook,
Instagram,	and	Mimi’s	blog.
Mimi	has	worked	with	about	three	hundred	different	brands
by	now,	but	she	says	the	day	she	got	a	call	from	Project	Runway
was	her	greatest	moment.
They	were	working	on	Project	Runway	Junior,	and	the	kids	were	going
to	be	using	vintage	patterns	and	turning	them	into	a	more	modern	look.
They	 contacted	 Simplicity	[Pattern]	 because	 they	 knew	 that’s	 what	 I
used,	and	asked	if	I	could	come	on	the	show	and	be	a	mentor	to	the	kids
and	 introduce	the	 challenge	 with	 Tim	 Gunn.	 And	 so	 the	 folks	 at
Simplicity	called	me	and	said,	“Hey,	Project	Runway	called.	They	want
you	to	come	do	the	show,”	and	I	was	like,	“What?	Yeah,	let’s	do	it!
When	Mimi	read	Crush	It!,	she	was	excited	to	learn	that	there
was	 a	 term	 for	 the	 type	 of	 business	 she	 was	 running—a
reactionary	business.	She’s	still	at	it,	looking	ahead	to	see	where
she	should	go	next.	She	spotted	a	big	hole	and	is	now	 in	 the
process	of	filling	it.
In	the	sewing	community,	I’ve	been	able	to	cross	all	boundaries.	I’ve
been	in	every	sewing	magazine	that	there	is.	I’ve	been	very	fortunate.
But	 I’m	 Latina,	 and	 a	 lot	 of	 my	 community	 is	 African	 American	 or
Latino,	and	when	I	looked	in	those	sewing	magazines,	there’s	nobody
that	represents	us.	I	got	to	a	point	where	I	really	wanted	to	see	more	of
myself	in	these	magazines,	and	I	thought,	Well,	I’ll	just	do	it	myself.	We
launched	Sew	 Sew	 Def,	 a	 digital	 multicultural	 sewing	 magazine	 that
focuses	on	both	men	and	women	and	will	feature	a	lot	of	makers	from	all
walks	of	life.
As	soon	as	we	launched	it,	it	got	a	lot	of	amazing	reviews.	People
were	posting	and	sharing	it	because	there	wasn’t	anything	like	that.	And
for	me,	I	think	that	the	more	people	I	help,	the	more	I	get	back.	I’ve	been
very	fortunate	that	I	get	to	work	with	all	of	these	brands,	but	not	a	lot	of
makers	do,	especially	those	who	look	like	me.	I	know	that	there	are	so
many,	because	they	follow	me,	and	I	follow	them	and	see	their	work.	If	I

can	bring	awareness	to	them	and	get	more	of	the	brands	that	I	work	with
to	have	a	better	representation	of	the	entire	sewing	community,	not	just	a
part	of	the	community,	then	I’ve	done	my	job.

The	Only	Thing	You	Need	to	Give
Yourself	to	Crush	It

How	I’m	Crushing	It
Pat	Flynn,	Smart	Passive	Income
IG:	@patflynn
Pat	Flynn	had	planned	to	be	an	architect	since	the	days	when
he	was	a	straight-A	high	school	student.	After	graduating	magna
cum	laude	from	UC-Berkeley,	he	quickly	landed	a	job	with	a
renowned	architectural	firm	in	the	Bay	Area,	where	he	became
one	of	 the	 youngest	 people	 ever	 to	 become	 job	 captain.	 His
future	bright,	his	401k	growing,	he	proposed	to	his	girlfriend,
who	said	yes.	It	was	March	2008.
You	know	what	happened	next.
Three	months	later,	Pat	lost	his	job,	along	with	2.5	million
other	people	in	the	country	that	year.	It	was	a	huge	blow.	Pat	had

even	gone	the	extra	mile	to	become	accredited	in	Leadership	in
Energy	 and	 Environmental	 Design	 (LEED),	 a	 professional
credential	that	proves	mastery	in	the	highly	specialized	area	of
green	building.	The	LEED	AP	exam	is	so	rigorous,	it	has	only
about	a	30	percent	pass	rate.
1
	His	bosses	had	assured	him	that	the
certification	 would	 look	 good	 on	 his	 résumé	 and	 factor
favorably	into	his	annual	reviews.	Eager	to	impress	people	and
differentiate	 himself	 from	 the	 competition,	 Pat	 studied	 during
much	of	2007	and	the	early	months	of	2008	to	prepare	for	the
test.	Overwhelmed	by	the	mountain	of	material—the	reference
guide	 alone	 was	 more	 than	 four	 hundred	pages—he	created	a
website	to	keep	himself	organized	and	make	it	easy	for	him	to
cross-link	and	access	his	resources	and	notes	from	wherever	he
happened	to	be,	because	he	traveled	so	much	for	work.	He	took
the	 exam	 in	 March	 2008	 and	 passed	 with	 high	marks.	 That’s
when	he	got	promoted	to	job	captain.
Because	he	was	in	that	role,	he	was	given	a	few	months	to
wrap	up	his	projects	before	his	job	ended.	That	bought	him	a
little	time	to	shrink	his	expenses	and	get	ready	to	live	extra	lean.
He	and	his	fiancée	moved	back	in	with	their	respective	parents,
and	 Pat	 started	 calling	 everyone	 he	 knew	 in	 the	 industry,	 and
every	 contractor	 or	 mechanical	 firm	 he’d	 ever	 worked	 with
through	his	employer,	to	beg	for	a	job.	No	one	was	hiring.	A	fat
lot	of	good	all	that	studying	had	done	him.	A	vague	sense	of
depression	started	to	settle	in.
In	the	meantime,	he	still	had	to	show	up	for	work.	Normally
he	listened	to	his	music	playlist	during	his	morning	commute—
he	was	taking	the	train,	which	was	cheaper	than	driving—but
one	 day	 he	 got	 bored	 with	 it	 and	 started	 poking	 around	 the
podcast	selections.	 He	 stumbled	 on	 the	 Internet	 Business
Mastery	show,	hosted	by	Jeremy	Frandsen	and	Jason	Van	Orden.
That	day	they	were	interviewing	someone	who	was	making	six
figures	 a	 year	 helping	 people	 pass	 something	 called	 a	 project
management	exam.	Pat	thought	about	his	website.	Aside	from
sharing	 it	 with	 a	 few	 coworkers,	 once	 he	 passed	 the	 exam	 in
early	 2008,	 he’d	 mostly	forgotten	 about	 it.	 He	 thought,	I’ve
passed	the	LEED	exam.	Maybe	I	could	create	something	people
could	use.	So	he	went	to	his	site.	Still	not	sure	how	he	was	going
to	monetize	it,	he	installed	some	traffic	analytics	to	prepare	for

whatever	marketing	he	figured	he’d	eventually	come	up	with.	It
didn’t	 take	 him	 long	 to	 see	 that	 thousands	 of	 people	 were
visiting	to	help	themselves	to	the	information	already	there.
He	activated	the	comments	section,	and	sure	enough,	people
started	 asking	 questions.	 He	 knew	 the	 answers.	 While
interacting	with	his	visitors,	he	started	spending	hours	engaging
with	 people	 in	 other	 architecture,	 LEED,	 and	 sustainable-
building	forums,	leaving	trails	to	bring	them	back	to	his	website.
At	the	end	of	July,	he	added	Google	AdSense	to	his	website.	By
the	end	of	the	first	day	that	the	site	was	Google	Ad	enabled,	he
had	earned	$1.18.	“It	was	the	most	incredible	feeling	ever.	This
could	actually	work!	Obviously,	you	could	find	that	amount	of
money	in	the	couch	cushions,	and	I	couldn’t	live	off	$1.18	per
day,	but	it	was	a	sign	to	me	to	keep	trying.	Who	else	out	there	is
doing	this	thing,	and	where	can	I	get	some	advice?”
The	hosts	of	the	podcast	that	had	inspired	Pat	to	monetize	his
website	 had	 launched	 a	 formal	 “mastermind”	 program,	 as
outlined	in	 Napoleon	 Hill’s	 1937	 self-help	 classic,	Think	 and
Grow	Rich,	to	help	walk	people	through	the	steps	of	building	an
online	business.	One	of	the	founders	moved	to	San	Diego,	where
Pat	was	living	with	his	parents,	and	agreed	to	host	an	in-person
group	meeting	where	people	could	talk	about	their	process.	Pat
decided	to	join	them,	meeting	at	a	Panera	Bread	not	far	from	his
parents’	 house.	 “I	 felt	 I	 had	 nothing	 to	 add,	 nothing	 to
contribute.	I	just	wanted	to	be	a	fly	on	the	wall	and	listen.	And
then	 everybody	 was	 introducing	 themselves	 and	 talking	 about
what	they	had	going	on.	And	I	was	so	impressed.	It	was	really
inspiring.”
It	was	also	really	intimidating,	and	as	it	came	close	to	being
his	turn	to	talk,	he	got	so	nervous	that	he	started	sweating	and
having	 trouble	 breathing.	 They	 asked	 him	 to	 explain	 what	 he
was	up	to,	and	he	told	them	that	he’d	just	gotten	laid	off	but	he
had	a	website	that	helped	people	pass	the	LEED	exam.	They	had
no	idea	what	that	was.
And	I’m	like,	“Yeah,	see,	nobody	knows	about	this.	This	isn’t	going	to
work	out	very	well.”
And	they	said,	“Well,	that	sounds	interesting	and	very	niche.	What’s
your	traffic	like?”
I	said,	“Oh,	you	know,	a	couple	thousand	people.”

“That’s	pretty	good,	you	know.	Two	thousand	people	a	month?	You
could	work	with	that.”
And	I	was	like,	“No,	two	thousand	a	day.”
Whaaaat?
They	were	stunned.	“You’re	not	monetizing	this?	You	don’t	have	an	e-
book?”
And	I	said,	“I	don’t	know	what	that	means.”
The	group	spent	the	next	thirty	minutes	explaining	to	Pat	what
he	could	and	should	do.
It	took	about	a	month-and-a-half	of	working	day	and	night	for
Pat	to	write	his	e-book,	which	was	a	compilation	of	much	of	the
same	information	that	was	on	the	website,	but	better	organized
and	easier	to	read,	complete	with	charts.	His	mentor	explained
what	tools	he	could	use	to	turn	it	into	a	PDF	and	sell	it	online
(he	used	one	called	e-Junkie).	He	put	a	graphic	on	the	sidebar	of
the	 site,	 a	 PayPal	 button,	 and	 a	 little	 description	 of	 the	 book,
which	he	priced	at	$19.99.	At	this	point,	he	was	a	week-and-a-
half	away	from	joblessness.	His	sole	comfort	was	knowing	that
if	 this	 didn’t	 work—and	 he	 was	 pretty	 sure	 it	 wouldn’t—his
parents	had	promised	they	wouldn’t	kick	him	out.
It	was	two	a.m.	when	he	went	live.	Pat	went	to	bed,	and	when
he	woke	up	four	hours	later	to	get	ready	to	work,	he	checked	to
see	if	he	had	gotten	any	sales.	Nothing.
“I	thought,	God,	this	is	worthless.	I	wasted	all	that	time.	And
then	I	gave	myself	an	out.	It	was	still	early.	Nobody	was	buying
study	guides	at	three	a.m.”	So	he	took	the	train	to	work,	arriving
around	eight-thirty	a.m.	He	checked	his	e-mails.	Nothing.
I	 was	 starting	 to	 despair,	 and	 then	 fifteen	 minutes	 later,	 I	 got	 a
notification	of	payment	received	for	$19.99	minus	the	fee	to	PayPal.	It
was	the	coolest	e-mail	I	ever	received.	Then	immediately	after	the	rush,	I
started	thinking,	Crap,	what	if	he	returns	it?	What	if	he	doesn’t	like	it?
What	if	he	sues	me	because	the	information	is	wrong?—all	this	negative
stuff	that	most	people	feel	when	they	do	something	outside	their	comfort
zone.	So,	I	go	outside	for	a	walk,	because	I’m	hyperventilating,	and	I
come	back	fifteen	minutes	later,	and	there’s	another	e-mail	from	PayPal
saying	that	I	had	made	a	sale.
So	even	when	I	was	out	on	a	walk,	I	was	making	another	sale,	and	that
just	blew	my	mind.	Like,	holy	crap,	this	thing	is	now	available	to	people
24/7/365,	 and	 I	 don’t	 have	 to	 be	 there	 in	 order	 to	 actually	 make	 the
transaction	happen.	Between	the	book	and	the	ads	on	my	site,	I	ended	up
generating	$7,908.55	that	month,	which	was	two-and-a-half	times	more
than	my	architecture	income.

There	were	a	few	ups	and	downs,	but	from	that	day	on	for	the
most	 part,	 Pat’s	 income	 grew	 month	 after	 month.	 He	 became
known	as	a	LEED	expert	because	no	one	else	was	providing	the
help	 people	 were	 seeking.	 All	 that	 work	 he	 had	 put	 into	 the
website	was	 paying	 off.	 By	 March	 2009,	 he	 was	 bringing	 in
$25,000	to	$35,000	per	month.
Along	 with	 questions	 about	 the	 LEED	 exam,	 Pat	 started
getting	requests	for	information	about	how	he	had	built	his	site
and	business.	He	remembered	all	the	business	gurus	he’d	looked
up,	the	sites	he’d	explored,	and	the	newsletters	he’d	subscribed
to	when	he	was	trying	to	figure	out	how	to	get	started	himself.
He	recalled	how	he’d	felt	that	they	were	doing	a	bait	and	switch,
luring	him	in	with	big	promises	but	ultimately	delivering	very
little	useful	information.	“I	wanted	somebody	to	be	up	front	and
honest	with	me,	but	I	felt	that	they	just	wanted	my	money.”
So	 he	 launched	 SmartPassiveIncome.com,	 a	 site	 where	 he
could	 document	 everything	 he	 had	 learned	 about	 starting	 an
online	business.
Two	 things	 happened	 that	 made	 him	 realize	 that	 these
websites	were	not	destined	to	be	temporary	income	generators	to
keep	him	afloat	until	he	could	get	his	architecture	career	back	on
track.
The	first	thing	was	a	phone	call.	About	two	months	after	Pat
launched	 SmartPassiveIncome.com,	 his	 old	 boss	 got	 in	 touch.
He	had	been	let	go	from	the	prominent	architecture	firm	as	well
and	 had	 started	 his	 own	 company.	 He’d	 invited	 a	 number	 of
Pat’s	old	 colleagues	 to	 join	 him,	 and	 he	 wanted	 Pat	 to	 come
work	for	him,	too.	He	offered	a	higher	salary	than	Pat	had	been
earning	at	the	old	firm,	a	private	office,	and	a	year’s	rent.	All	Pat
had	to	do	was	move	back	to	Irvine	and	pick	up	where	he	left	off.
“It	didn’t	take	me	more	than	two	or	three	seconds	to	say,	‘No,
thank	you.’	And	when	I	hung	up,	I	thought	about	his	offer	and
was	very	surprised	that	I	had	answered	so	quickly.	Why?	It	was
a	sign	that	this	was	the	direction	I	wanted	to	go,	and	I	needed	to
really	own	it.	I	wanted	to	become	an	entrepreneur.”
The	 second	 thing	 was	 that	 he	 discovered	Crush	It!,	 which
helped	him	come	to	terms	with	what	had	to	happen	next.	“The
book	says,	‘If	you	want	to	make	money	selling	worms,	do	it,	and
own	it,	and	be	that	guy.’	The	LEED	exam	stuff?	Those	were	my

worms.	I	was	that	guy.”
It	wasn’t	just	reading	the	text	of	Crush	It!	that	influenced	how
Pat	 ran	 his	 business.	 Visiting	 the	 book’s	 Amazon	 page,	 Pat
noticed	something	else.
Gary	 was	 actually	 replying	 to	 the	 occasional	 negative	 reviewer	 and
saying,	“Hey,	I’m	sorry	this	book	didn’t	speak	to	you.	Let’s	get	on	the
phone	and	chat.”	I	couldn’t	believe	that	an	author	was	paying	attention,
responding	to	comments,	and	offering	a	phone	or	Skype	number.	Many
of	the	one-	or	two-star	reviewers	came	back	with	a	follow-up	comment.
They	might	not	have	changed	their	opinion,	but	they’d	say,	“Gary,	I	still
don’t	agree	with	you,	but	I	so	appreciate	the	time	you	took	to	reach	out
to	me	and	understand	where	I	was	coming	from.”	That	impressed	me
more	 than	 even	 the	 content	 of	 the	 book	 itself.	 Where	 is	 the	ROI	 in
responding	to	a	one-star	comment?	I	saw	that	(a)	he	took	the	time,	(b)	he
cared	enough	to	reach	out,	and	(c)	he	cared	to	see	what	he	could	do	to
improve.
After	 that,	 Pat	 adopted	 the	 same	 response	 strategy	 to	 any
negative	 comments	 he	 received,	 and	 the	 ROI	 has	 been	 clear.
“Sometimes	those	people	with	whom	I’ve	talked	on	calls	just
misunderstood	 something	 I	 said	 and	 have	 gone	 on	 to	 become
some	of	my	biggest	fans.”
Right	around	this	time,	Pat’s	earnings	show	a	striking	upward
inflection	 point.	 “I’m	 not	 saying	 that	Crush	 It!	was	 the	 sole
reason	why	I	was	able	to	grow	my	income	to	what	it	is	now,	but
I	went	bigger,	that’s	for	sure.	I	started	to	produce	more	things
instead	of	being	just	a	blogger.	I	started	to	look	for	other	ways	to
expand	beyond	my	realm	of	comfort.”
And	expand	he	did.	He	started	a	YouTube	channel	in	2009.	In
2010,	he	launched	the	Smart	Passive	Income	podcast,	which	has
seen	 more	 than	 forty	 million	 downloads.	 In	 2011,	 he	 started
accepting	 offers	 to	 speak.	 To	 provide	 a	 space	 to	 answer	 the
deluge	of	questions	he	gets	from	his	followers,	he	then	created	a
daily	Ask	Pat	podcast,	as	well	as	a	few	others	to	address	niche
subjects.	His	self-published	book	was	a	Wall	Street	Journal	best
seller.
All	along,	he	followed	through	on	his	commitment	of	being	a
“crash	test	dummy”	for	online	business	development.	He	started
creating	new	businesses	live	in	front	of	people—like	a	site	for
people	 interested	 in	 starting	 food	 trucks	 and	 one	 for	 people
interested	in	becoming	security	guards—and	posting	his	revenue

for	those,	too.	If	he	made	a	mistake,	he	made	it	in	public.	He
detailed	 every	 step	 of	 the	 process	 along	 the	 way.	 In	 the	 end,
Pat’s	passion	for	architecture	and	design	was	surpassed	by	his
passion	for	helping	others.
I’m	 getting	 e-mails	 from	 people,	 paragraphs	 long,	 thanking	 me	 for
helping	them	save	time	and	effort	or	for	helping	them	get	a	promotion.
I’ve	gotten	handwritten	letters	from	people	I’ve	helped	pass	the	exam.
The	interesting	thing	is	that	in	October	2009,	I	asked	people	why	they
had	 bought	 the	 e-book	 from	 me.	 I	 thought	 the	 information	 would	 be
useful	so	I	could	continue	to	do	whatever	it	was	they	were	going	to	tell
me	was	working.	About	a	quarter	of	those	who	responded	said	things
like,	“Pat”—that	was	another	cool	thing;	they	were	calling	me	by	name,
as	if	they	knew	me—“Pat,	I	bought	from	you	because	you	finally	gave
me	an	opportunity	to	pay	you	back.	I	didn’t	even	need	the	book;	I’ve
already	passed	the	exam.	But	you	provided	me	so	much	information,	I
felt	I	needed	a	way	to	give	back	to	you.”	I	eventually	learned	that	this
reciprocity	is	human	nature,	and	I	was	setting	up	systems	for	that	kind	of
interaction	and	transaction.
The	great	thing	about	Pat’s	success	is	how	many	options	it
affords	him.	He	has	been	expanding	his	philanthropic	reach,	and
he	 serves	 on	 the	 board	 of	 an	 educational	 nonprofit.	 He’s
interested	 in	 getting	 involved	 in	 shaping	 education	 policy.
Despite	his	 belief	 in	Crush	It!,	 he	 isn’t	 trying	 to	 be	 another
GaryVee.	 “I	 am	 who	 I	 am	 and	 he	 is	 who	 he	 is.	 That’s	 what
Crush	It!	is	also	about,	you	know:	being	confident	in	who	you
are,	not	trying	to	be	like	somebody	else.	When	you	really	own	it,
and	you	put	yourself	out	there	and	be	you,	your	vibe	is	going	to
attract	your	tribe,	and	you’re	going	to	be	able	to	make	change	in
this	world.”
Pat’s	story	is	waiting	to	be	told	a	thousand	more	times.	I	know
many	of	you	have	niche	expertise,	yet	you	don’t	think	it	could
possibly	 be	 a	 real	 business.	 But	 come	 on!	 I	 mean,	 the	 LEED
exam?	 Are	 you	 kidding	 me?	 If	 Pat	 Flynn	 can	 make	 a	 stellar
income	off	a	website	dedicated	to	helping	people	pass	an	exam
only	a	few	people	in	the	country	have	ever	heard	of,	you	can	do
it	with	soccer	trivia	or	smoothies.	Please	dig	deep	into	what	you
know	best	or	what	you	love	most,	or	better	yet,	what	you	know
best	and	love	 most,	 and	 start	 creating	 content.	 Follow	 the
blueprint	Pat’s	story	provides;	go	deep,	go	niche,	and	provide
real	value	in	the	form	of	entertainment	or	information.
Though	it	may	seem	that,	over	the	years,	influencers	have	had

their	pick	of	thousands	of	platforms	they	could	use	to	establish
their	brands,	you	need	only	both	hands	and	a	few	toes	to	count
the	number	that	actually	had	the	ability	to	grow	big	enough	to
scale.	It’s	really,	really	hard	for	a	platform	to	earn	a	spot	in	this
book.	 If	 I’ve	 included	 it,	 it’s	 because	 it’s	 grown	into	 such	 a
beast,	it	cannot	be	ignored,	or	because	I	see	the	potential	for	it	to
become	 that	 kind	 of	 beast.	 When	 considering	where	 to	 build
your	personal	brand,	you	want	to	use	nothing	less	than	platforms
upon	which	you	can	actually	build	your	life.	Every	platform	we
discuss	in	the	following	chapters	fits	that	description.

II
Create	Your	Pillar

First,	Do	This
No	matter	what	kind	of	influencer	you	want	to	become,	everyone	must	start
with	this	step:	create	a	Facebook	business	page.
Facebook	is	the	cost	of	entry	to	building	a	personal	brand.	Do	not	try	to	tell
me	that	you	don’t	have	to	do	it	because	you’re	targeting	the	twenty-two-and-
unders,	who	are	not	on	Facebook	in	the	same	numbers	as	older	groups.	As	you’ll
see,	the	strides	Facebook	is	making	in	video	make	it	likely	that	it’s	about	to
become	more	appealing	to	those	young	viewers.	You	want	to	be	waiting	for	them
when	 they	 start	 opening	 Facebook	 accounts.	 Facebook	 will	 get	 to	 the	 young
demo;	 you	 can	 count	 on	 it.	 Don’t	ever	 underestimate	 Mark	 Zuckerberg,	 and
don’t	ever	bet	against	Facebook.
How	I’m	Crushing	It
Costa	Kapothanasis,	Costa	Oil—10	Minute	Oil	Change
IG:	@costakapo
Constantine	 “Costa”	 Kapothanasis	 sounds	 like	 a	 practical
man.	 The	 first-generation	 Greek	 American	 from	 Portland,
Maine,	 won	a	 Division	 1	 baseball	 scholarship	 to	 a	 college	 in
Maryland.	 Forced	 to	 give	 up	 the	 sport	 professionally	 after	 a
shoulder	 injury,	he	 moved	 on	 to	 earn	 a	 master	 of	 science	 in

finance.	After	graduation,	he	worked	for	several	large	financial
companies,	but	nothing	stuck.	“I	either	got	fired	or	was	almost
fired	from	every	job.”	He	chafed	against	bureaucracy.	Not	only
did	 these	large	 firms	 force	 him	 to	 follow	 strict,	 cumbersome
protocols	that	to	him	seemed	inefficient	and	counterproductive,
but	also	their	restrictive	social-media	policies	hampered	his	side
business	 of	 making	 custom,	 hand-carved	 baseball	 bats.	 Bank
trading	hours	 were	 9:30	 a.m.	 to	 4:00	 p.m.,	 and	 Costa	 found
himself	missing	opportunities	because	he	couldn’t	respond	right
away	to	potential	customers	on	Twitter,	which	was	enjoying	its
heyday.	It	didn’t	help	that,	as	the	years	went	on,	friends	from	his
baseball	days	made	it	to	the	majors	and	were	making	millions
playing	the	game	they	loved,	while	he	was	sitting	in	a	cubicle.
Many	years	went	by	in	which	he	avoided	watching	baseball	on
television.
He	needed	to	plan	an	escape,	so	while	still	working	for	the
financial	firm,	he	sold	the	assets	to	the	baseball	bat	business	and
bought	a	quick-lube,	a	place	where	you	take	your	car	for	a	fast
oil	change.	It	wasn’t	the	most	glamorous	or	exciting	business,
but	he	saw	it	as	an	investment	in	a	“quasi-utility,”	almost	like
electricity	or	water:	in	a	car-dependent	country	with	few	mass
transit	 options,	 most	 Americans	 will	 eventually	 need	 an	 oil
change.	 Then,	 as	 was	 almost	 inevitable,	 he	 got	 fired.	 It	was
fantastic!	 “Getting	 fired	 was	 this	 amazing	 thing	 for	 me.	 My
quality	of	life	went	through	the	roof.	I	never	realized	how	much
of	a	weight	was	on	me,	and	now	it	was	gone,	and	it	put	me	into
high	gear	to	do	something	with	the	business.”
Costa	went	all	in	on	his	quick-lube	company,	which	he	named
Quick	Change	Oil,	but	his	strategies	weren’t	all	that	effective.
Direct	 mail.	 Search-engine	 optimization.	 An	 iHeartRadio
commercial	that	was	before	its	time.	He	wasted	a	lot	of	money.
He	found	himself	about	eight	months	later	alone	in	the	store	on
New	Year’s	Day,	2016,	because	he	had	given	his	employees	the
day	 off.	 Sales	 were	 not	 great,	 and	 he	 was	 in	 a	 tough	 spot.
Nothing	was	going	on,	so	he	was	reading	a	book	called	Crush	It!
The	more	he	read,	the	more	he	thought,	Man,	I	need	to	do	this.
No	 more	 direct	 mail,	 no	 more	 SEO,	 no	 more	 commercials.
Instead,	he	took	to	YouTube,	and	in	between	cars	and	after	work
until	two	a.m.,	he	taught	himself	about	Facebook	ads.	“I	didn’t

want	 to	 storytell	 incorrectly.	 I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 miss	 an
opportunity.”
By	 February,	 100	 percent	 of	 his	 marketing	 budget	 was
devoted	 to	 Facebook	 ads,	 and	 he	 was	 immersed	 in	 social
engagement	and	creating	content.	He	used	Twitter	searches	to
find	 any	 vehicle-related	 conversations	 that	 would	 give	 him	 a
chance	to	talk	to	people.	From	Chevy	Cobalts	to	Porsches,	he
photographed	 his	 customers’	 cars	 for	 Instagram,	 tricking	 the
images	 out	 with	photo	 filters	 to	 make	 them	 look	 snazzy	 and
sharp	 (customers	 like	 seeing	 their	 cars	 online	 so	 much,	 he
doesn’t	have	to	ask	them	for	permission	anymore—they	ask	him
to	do	it	first).	He	started	putting	out	educational	videos	to	help
inform	potential	customers	about	the	ins	and	outs	of	their	cars.
“We	 have	 put	 out	 videos	 on	 the	 different	 types	 of	 oils,	 the
difference	between	a	full-synthetic	and	a	conventional,	on	when
you	 should	 do	 an	 engine	 flush.	 And	 we’ve	 gotten	 lots	 of
feedback.	People	will	type	messages	like,	‘This	is	the	first	time
anyone	has	actually	explained	to	me	what	the	purpose	of	my	air
filter	 is.’	 I	 truly	believe	 that	 the	 most	 educated	 customer	 will
always	pick	us.”
Less	than	a	year	after	that	New	Year’s	Day	when	he	sat	in	his
empty	 shop	 wondering	 how	 he	 was	 going	 to	 jump-start	 his
business,	he	had	six	store	locations	and	was	under	contract	for
two	 more,	 spread	 out	 over	 several	 states.	 Today	 he’s	 busy
running	the	business,	keeping	his	social-media	engagement	up
and	staying	genuine,	creating	content,	and	appearing	on	various
financial	TV	and	radio	shows	to	talk	about	his	journey.	He	was
even	invited	to	speak	at	a	university	entrepreneurship	program.
He	and	his	wife	are	talking	about	starting	a	family.	He’s	been
working	on	building	his	personal	brand,	too—in	2017,	all	the
businesses	were	renamed	Costa	Oil—10	Minute	Oil	Change.

Get	Discovered
You	need	to	understand	something:	when	you’re	starting	with	nothing,	you	will
find	 that	 your	 absolute	 breakthrough	 opportunities	will	 be	 developed	 in	 two
ways:
1.	By	the	smart	use	of	hashtags,	a	strategy	that	requires	an	unbelievably
long	grind.
2.	By	direct-messaging,	i.e.,	reaching	out	directly	to	people	and	offering
something	of	value	in	return	for	their	attention,	a	strategy	that	requires
an	unbelievably	long	grind.
It’s	 the	 second	 one	 that	 I	 believe	 holds	 the	 most	 promise,	 which	 is	 why,
whenever	 possible,	 I’ve	 included	 instructions	 on	how	 to	 collaborate	 and
business-develop	within	each	platform	we	discuss	in	this	book.	Collaborations
are	the	absolutely	most	tried-and-true	way	to	grow	a	fan	base	quickly—quickly
being	a	relative	term.	In	most	cases,	you	should	count	on	this	process	taking
years,	not	months.	If	that	bothers	you,	close	the	book.
Many	are	uncomfortable	with	the	idea	of	direct-messaging	total	strangers,	but
let	me	help	you	think	about	these	total	strangers	another	way.	Let’s	say	a	friend
invites	you	to	join	a	group	for	dinner	at	a	restaurant,	and	she	also	brings	a	couple
you	don’t	know.	You	wind	up	sitting	next	to	each	other	and	have	a	great	time.
You’re	an	interior	designer,	and	you	find	out	that	this	couple	is	in	the	beginning
stages	of	deciding	to	redo	their	home.	Do	you	hide	the	fact	that	you’re	an	interior
designer?	Of	course	not.	It’s	natural	to	tell	them	what	you	do	for	a	living,	and

that’s	going	to	become	part	of	your	conversation	because	you	just	discovered	a
mutual	interest.	Now,	at	the	end	of	the	evening,	would	it	be	weird	to	hand	them
your	card	and	say,	“Check	out	my	website,	maybe	we	can	work	together.	Or	let
me	know	if	you	need	other	recommendations.”	Of	course	not.	You	have	a	mutual
interest,	they	need	a	service,	you	can	provide	that	service.	It	follows	that	you
should	give	them	the	opportunity	to	decide	if	you	would	be	a	good	fit.
Online,	 social-media	 platforms	 are	 the	 mutual	 friends	 connecting	 you	 to
millions	of	people	that	share	your	interest	in	interior	design.	Your	job	is	to	do	the
research	and	find	out	which	would	find	the	most	value	in	your	offer	and	then
make	your	case.	I’ll	share	with	you	the	specific	details	on	how	to	do	this	in
upcoming	 chapters,	 but	 the	 general	 process	 is	 essentially	 the	same	 on	 each
platform:	reach	out,	make	an	offer	they	can’t	refuse,	and	get	to	work	producing
something	that	doesn’t	make	them	regret	giving	you	a	chance.
Now,	there’s	something	you	should	know:	right	this	minute	I	have	around	five
hundred	DMs	from	people	who	want	something	from	me.	You	know	what	I	have
to	say	to	them?	Mazel	tov,	and	go	away.	And	that’s	if	I’m	in	the	mood	to	be	nice.
Why	would	I	encourage	you	to	try	to	get	other	influencers’	attention	when	I
ignore	or	reject	the	majority	of	people	who	try	this	tactic	with	me?	Because	if
they	were	doing	it	right,	I	wouldn’t	reject	them.	If	I	felt	they	weren’t	just	trying
to	use	me,	if	I	thought	they	were	genuinely	trying	to	be	helpful,	if	they	could
recognize	a	hole	in	my	business	and	had	the	knowledge	and	skills	to	fill	it,	I
might	consider	talking	to	them.
When	you	can’t	offer	exposure	or	money,	what	do	you	have?	Knowledge	and
skill.	Do	you	own	a	pizza	shop?	You	could	offer	free	pizza	from	your	shop	for
six	months.	Are	you	a	graphic	designer?	You	could	offer	to	make	six	hundred
custom	filters.	Do	you	own	a	liquor	store?	As	soon	as	your	targets	post	shots	of
themselves	enjoying	wine,	you	could	direct-message	them	with	an	offer	for	a
case	a	month	for	the	rest	of	the	year	(if	your	state	laws	allow	that—New	Jersey
doesn’t	☹).	People	will	tell	you	not	to	sell	yourself	cheap,	but	you	can	stand	on
that	principle	only	when	people	are	willing	to	buy	what	you’re	selling.	(For	a
perfect	example	of	how	to	do	this	right,	read	DRock’s	story	in	chapter	3	of	my
book	#AskGaryVee,	or	you	can	hear	his	version	of	the	story	in	his	Medium	piece,
“How	I	Got	My	Job	for	Gary	Vaynerchuk.”)*
If	established	influencers	see	an	upside	to	collaborating	with	you—allowing
you	to	post	content	on	their	pages,	working	together	to	create	content—they’ll
get	back	in	touch.	If	not,	they’ll	say	no	thanks,	usually	by	not	answering.	But	if
you	reach	out	for	six	or	seven	hours	a	day,	you	will	eventually	find	someone
willing	 to	 try	 something	 new	 with	 you.	 Once	 you	 do,	 you’ll	have	 raised
awareness	with	thousands	of	people	who	previously	didn’t	know	you	were	alive.

Provide	something	valuable	to	your	collab	partner,	and	you’ll	quickly	raise	your
profile	as	an	influencer	and	in	all	likelihood	make	a	new	friend.
I	won’t	lie.	Biz-deving	this	way	is	hard,	tedious,	and	time-consuming.	I	like
tedious.	It	means	most	people	won’t	do	it.	If	you	do,	you	will	win.	If	you’ve	got
the	money	to	run	ads	on	all	these	platforms	or	pay	influencers	to	feature	your
product,	more	power	to	you.	But	if	you’re	just	starting	out	and	have	no	money,
this	is	the	number-one	thing	you	can	do	to	build	your	brand.

Musical.ly
I’m	going	to	start	with	Musical.ly	because	I’m	betting	that	unless	you’re	the
parent	of	a	seven-to-eleven-year-old,	you’ve	never	heard	of	it.	If	you	have,	I’m
betting	most	of	you	never	once	thought	it	might	be	worth	investigating	for	any
other	reason	than	checking	on	your	kid’s	online	activities.	Musical.ly,	like	a	lot
of	its	users,	is	young	and	creative	and	eager	to	grow	up.	It’s	a	fun	platform	to
consider,	because	I	think	it’s	the	one	most	likely	to	be	underestimated.	It’s	also
the	one	most	likely	to	no	longer	exist	once	you	read	this	book,	because	as	of	this
writing,	its	popularity	has	been	in	decline	for	about	six	months.	But	you	need	to
learn	about	 it	 anyway,	 for	 reasons	 that	 should	 become	 clear	 in	 the	 next	 few
paragraphs.
Despite	the	evidence	that	platforms	that	start	out	hot	with	young	people	can
and	 do	 successfully	 cross	 over	 to	 an	 older	 audience,	the	 majority	 of
entrepreneurs	will	still	dismiss	Musical.ly,	which	is	great,	because	it	leaves	the
platform	wide	open	for	you	to	take	it	over.	You’ll	have	fun	doing	it,	too.	Musers,
as	 the	 users	 of	 Musical.ly	 are	 called,	 have	 turned	 this	 app	 into	a	 creative
phenomenon.	 Originally,	 it	 allowed	 people	 to	 make	 fifteen-second	 lip-sync
videos,	making	public	the	rock-star	impersonations	and	glamming	that	previous
generations	used	to	do	in	front	of	their	full-length	closet	mirrors.	Today	the	form
has	evolved	to	include	original	music,	comedy	skits,	and	even	mini–educational
videos.	 Ballerinas,	 makeup	 artists,	 gymnasts,	 jugglers,	athletes,	 rappers,
vloggers,	and	hams	of	all	stripes—including	Jiff	the	Pomeranian—are	using	the
medium	to	show	off	their	skills	and	style.	You	can	create	content	as	long	as	five
minutes,	compile	video	clips	into	stories,	and	collaborate	on	duets	with	 other

musers.
The	company	saw	immediate	favor	among	the	tween	and	teen	crowd	as	soon
as	 it	 launched	 in	 August	 2014,	 with	 people	 not	 only	downloading	 it,	 but
returning	 to	 it	 and	 engaging	 in	 high	 numbers.
1
	 For	 the	 first	 months	 of	 its
existence,	it	grew,	but	at	a	slow,	steady	pace.	Then	the	designers	decided	to	make
a	few	minor	changes	to	the	app	design,	one	of	which	included	relocating	the
Musical.ly	logo	so	that	it	wasn’t	cropped	out	every	time	a	video	was	shared	on
Instagram	 or	 Twitter.	 As	 soon	 as	 that	 happened,	new	 users	 flooded	 the	 app.
Learning	from	the	mistakes	of	its	predecessors,	which	too	often	tried	to	contain
users	to	their	platforms,	it	helps	musers	build	their	fan	base	by	allowing	them	to
share	its	content	on	Instagram,	Twitter,	Facebook,	and	WhatsApp.	It	now	has
200	million	users,	30	percent	of	whom	spend	thirty	minutes	or	more	there	per
day.
2
No	doubt	a	small	percentage	of	musers	are	refugees	from	Vine,	the	defunct
Twitter-owned	 six-second-video	 platform	 that	 was	quickly	 overshadowed	 by
Instagram	video	and	Snapchat,	thanks	to	their	slightly	longer	formats	and	fun
editing	 tools.	 The	 natural	question	 is,	 of	 course,	 how	 will	 Musical.ly	 avoid
Vine’s	 fate?	 One	 way	 is	 by	 aging	 up,	 creating	 features	 that	 appeal	 to	 their
audience	once	those	kids	become	teens,	so	they	don’t	graduate	to	Snapchat	or
Insta.	And	it	will	have	to	evolve	to	compete	for	the	younger	audience,	too,	as
Snapchat	and	Insta	start	trending	younger	and	younger.	The	way	I	see	it,	for
Musical.ly	to	break	away	from	its	competition	and	gain	momentum	within	the
twelve-to-seventeen-year-old	crowd,	it	will	have	to	pivot	the	way	Facebook	did
a	few	years	ago,	when	it	successfully	transitioned	into	a	mobile-first	platform
even	though	it	was	originally	designed	for	desktop.	Musical.ly	is	so	young,	it
should	be	limber	and	flexible	enough	to	be	able	to	adapt	itself	to	whatever	is	the
next	big	thing	that	changes	the	platform	paradigm.	Maybe	it’ll	be	voice.	Maybe
it’ll	be	something	that	we	can’t	even	envision	yet.
Clearly,	emerging	musicians	have	a	natural	opportunity	here,	but	of	course
one	of	the	best	ways	to	become	a	big	fish	is	to	swim	in	a	small	pool,	creatively
adapting	 a	 platform	 to	 your	 needs.	 That’s	 the	 tactic	 I	 used	 to	 build	 brand
awareness	 on	 Musical.ly.	You	 might	 wonder	 why	 I,	 a	 forty-two-year-old
businessman	with	few	ties	to	the	music	industry,	have	any	interest	in	garnering
attention	on	a	platform	geared	toward	thirteen-year-olds.	Simple:	those	thirteen-
year-olds	grow	up	to	become	eighteen-year-old	entrepreneurs	and	twenty-five-
year-old	marketers.	When	I	was	twelve	and	dreaming	of	building	businesses,	no
one	 knew	 what	to	 call	 me.	Entrepreneur	 wasn’t	 part	 of	 our	 lexicon.	 Today,
entrepreneurs	are	pop-culture	icons,	and	the	kids	are	growing	up	watching	Shark
Tank.	Maybe	I	can	help	inspire	them	to	get	where	they	want	to	go	faster.	Maybe

one	day	we’ll	do	business	together.
One	of	my	earliest	forays	into	the	platform	came	about	because	I	thought	kids
could	get	some	value	from	hearing	sage	words	from	hip-hop	artist	Fat	Joe	on
#AskGaryVee.	To	help	the	demographic	find	the	show,	I	posted	a	clip	of	me
jumping	through	the	ceiling,	set	to	Fat	Joe’s	“All	the	Way	Up,”	with	the	hope
that	if	they	liked	what	they	saw,	they’d	keep	watching	and	listening.	If	they	did,
they’d	catch	the	meme	I	created	from	a	clip	of	me	pushing	hard	work,	set	to
Rihanna’s	song	“Work,”	or	an	inspirational	video	reminding	people	to	always
look	up	to	the	stars,	set	to	Coldplay’s	“A	Sky	Full	of	Stars.”	I	made	another	one
of	 me	 remembering	how	 much	 I	 hated	 school,	 how	 I’d	 sit	 in	 the	 classroom
thinking	that	one	day	I	would	prove	all	my	teachers	and	classmates	who	thought
I	was	a	loser	wrong.	Imagine	how	much	that	message	might	mean	to	a	kid	who’s
getting	the	same	shit	today?	What	if	just	a	few	of	those	kids	see	it	and	realize
there’s	 someone	 out	 there	 who	 gets	 them,	 and	 they	 find	 out	 what	 I’ve
accomplished	and	think,	Yeah.	Me	too.	This	is	how	someone	like	me,	who’s	not
in	 the	 music	 industry	 and	 can’t	 sing,	 managed	 to	 tie	 business	 and
entrepreneurship	into	 a	 so	 called	 lip-syncing	 platform,	 not	 only	 to	 make	 a
difference	but	to	make	fans	for	life.
Even	 before	 I	 deployed	 these	 content	 strategies,	 however,	 when	 I	 was	 just
gathering	information	so	I	could	figure	out	how	to	build	out	my	profile,	I	asked
two	of	Musical.ly’s	top	users	to	make	guest	appearances	on	#AskGaryVee.	On
episode	 198,	 I’m	flanked	 by	 two	 fifteen-year-olds,	 Ariel	 Martin	 and	 Ariana
Trejos.	Definitely	not	my	typical	guests,	but	we	had	a	blast.	My	audience	and	I
got	access	to	their	insights,	and	they	got	the	chance	to	show	their	skills	on	a	big
YouTube	show.	The	thing	is,	my	show	is	peanuts	compared	to	the	big	venues
where	they’ve	appeared,	like	the	red	carpet	at	the	People’s	Choice	Awards.	The
real	value	to	me	is	that	when	their	fans	Google	them	and	find	the	Musical.ly
memes	they	made	while	on	my	show,	it	will	raise	their	awareness	of	my	brand.
When	 Baby	 Ariel	 is	 a	 humongous	 star	 (in	 2017	 she	 was	 listed	 in	Time
magazine’s	third	annual	list	of	most	influential	people	on	the	Internet),	I’ll	have
the	content	that	the	world	is	hunting	for	in	a	few	years	when	they	want	to	see
who	she	was	in	her	early	days.*
Even	if	Musical.ly	turns	out	to	be	a	fad,	let	us	remember	that	every	season,
brands	pay	millions	of	dollars	to	run	ads	against	pilots	for	new	series,	most	of
which	statistically	will	not	exist	after	nine	months.	As	of	2012,	65	percent	of
new	shows	are	canceled	after	one	season.

	It	literally	does	not	matter	how	long	a
platform	 lasts.	 What	 matters	 is	 that	 it	 exists.	 If	 you’re	 seeking	 to	 build	 your
audience,	go	where	the	audience	goes,	wherever	that	may	lead.	Consume	the
platform’s	content	for	a	couple	of	weeks	to	get	a	feel	for	what’s	appealing	to

users,	then	strategize	how	you	can	create	content	that	will	successfully	penetrate
that	market.	Get	to	know	it	and	put	your	resources	into	it.	Not	all,	mind	you.	Just
some.	More	if	you’re	comfortable	with	the	platform,	less	if	you	decide	it’s	not
for	you.	But	to	label	any	platform	as	irrelevant	shows	a	lack	of	imagination	and
vision.	Don’t	ever	doubt	that	the	designers	of	the	platform	have	a	greater	vision
for	it	than	whatever	it	is	you	see	now.	Platforms	evolve,	either	by	design	or	by
accident,	when	the	market	takes	them	in	a	whole	other	direction.	If	you	get	in
early,	 you	 can	 evolve	 with	a	 platform.	 Become	 a	 real	 presence	 on	 it,	 and	 its
designers	may	even	come	to	you	and	ask	for	your	help.	For	example,	they	may
give	you	early	beta	program	access,	letting	you	play	around	with	new	features
they’re	 hoping	 to	 launch.	 Or	 you	 could	 get	first	 dibs	 on	 creating	 fresh	 new
content	in	a	format	or	style	no	one	has	ever	seen	before,	essentially	creating	a
symbiotic	relationship	between	your	brand	and	the	platform.
No	one	can	finish	a	marathon	without	proper	training.	Whether	you	do	it	on
the	treadmill	or	the	running	path,	you	have	to	get	to	know	your	body,	build	your
endurance,	and	figure	out	what	physical,	nutritional,	and	psychological	practices
extract	your	 best	 performance.	 The	 same	 goes	 for	 social-media	 platforms.	 In
2012,	I	was	bullish	about	an	app	called	Socialcam	that	was	successful	for	maybe
nine	 months	 before	 it	 flopped.	 In	 those	 nine	 months,	 however,	 I	 learned
strategies	that	served	me	well	when	Vine	and	Instagram	came	along.
The	only	thing	you	risk	by	taking	leaps	into	the	social-media	unknown	is	time.
You	want	to	break	out	and	live	the	life?	You	say	you’re	going	to	die	if	you	have
to	spend	one	more	day	in	your	accounting	job,	but	you’re	not	willing	to	risk	your
time	in	 case	 a	 platform	 turns	 out	 to	 be	 a	 MySpace	 or	 a	 Vine	 instead	 of	 a
Facebook	or	an	Instagram?	Who	are	you	to	be	so	fancy?	When	you’re	nothing
but	a	beggar,	you	don’t	get	to	be	choosy.	Download	every	new	social	platform,
taste	it,	and	understand	it.	Drop	it	if	it	doesn’t	work	for	you	or	you	can’t	get
comfortable,	but	never	reject	anything	without	educating	yourself	about	it	first
(which	is	good	advice	for	like,	life).
Musical.ly	101
Work	those	hashtags.	I	can’t	believe	we	didn’t	talk	about	hashtags	in	Crush	It!	In
fact,	I	didn’t	mention	them	in	print	until	my	third	book!	Riding	hashtags	is	one
of	the	bedrocks	of	social	media	and	a	key	to	discoverability.	One	of	the	quickest
ways	to	build	traction	on	Musical.ly,	for	example,	would	be	to	open	the	app,
examine	the	trending	tags	on	the	Discover	page,	and	work	on	producing	great

content	around	those	trending	tags	so	that	you	can	be	spotted	by	kids	who	would
otherwise	have	no	way	to	know	you’re	worth	checking	out.	That	includes	the
curators	at	Musical.ly	itself,	who	are	apt	to	reward	good	content	by	selecting	it	to
be	automatically	featured	when	people	open	the	app.	That	hand	curation	creates
more	 random	 opportunities	 for	 you	 to	 be	 seen	 than	 you	 might	 find	 on	 other
platforms.	Don’t	count	on	winning	this	virtual	lottery	ticket	as	your	shortcut	to
stardom,	 though.	 The	 amount	 of	 hard	 work	 and	 creativity	 you	 apply	 to	your
content	 will	 be	 a	 much	 better	 predictor	 of	 your	 success.	 You	 can	 also	 create
amazing	content	coupled	with	your	own	clever,	original	hashtags.	Knowing	your
way	 around	 hashtag	 culture	 is	 an	 excellent	 way	 to	 give	 your	 quality	 content
longevity	and	legs.
Collaborate.	 There	 was	 a	 time	 when	 the	 whole	 appeal	 of	 stars	 was	 their
untouchable	quality.	It	gave	them	mystery	and	cachet,	and	if	we	did	actually	get
access	to	them,	in	the	form	of,	say,	an	autographed	photo,	that	meant	a	lot.	But
today’s	stars	are	measured	by	their	approachability,	and	they	can	pay	a	serious
price	 if	 they	 get	 too	 Hollywood.	 Take	 advantage	 of	 this.	There	 is	 nothing
stopping	 lyricists	 or	 songwriters	 from	 uploading	 their	 creations,	 direct-
messaging	top	musers,	and	giving	them	a	chance	to	lip-sync	or	even	perform
their	material.	You	could	do	the	same	thing	with	a	funny	skit,	or	a	poem,	or	some
other	work.	I’ve	said	it	ad	nauseam:	the	best	way	to	reach	out	to	a	community	is
to	become	part	of	a	community.	Engage,	comment,	share,	and	create	without
asking	anyone	for	anything.	Become	part	of	the	community,	and	you’ll	have	a
much	better	chance	of	getting	someone	to	create	a	meme	using	your	material,	or
better	yet,	create	your	own	meme	that	other	people	fall	in	love	with	and	share.
That	 doesn’t	 mean	 that	 if	 your	 brand	 would	 be	 appealing	 to	 twelve-to-
seventeen-year-old	girls,	you	shouldn’t	spend	any	money	on	Musical.ly.	It’s	just
that	in	this	one	man’s	point	of	view,	the	top	1	to	2	percent	of	influencers	on	any
platform	are	often	overpriced.	Not	always;	you	might	get	lucky	and	find	some
who	are	great	deals	because,	despite	having	the	most	reach,	they’ve	underpriced
themselves.	But	eventually	people	get	wise,	so	don’t	count	on	it.	Regardless,	the
enormous	opportunity	for	marketers	can	be	found	in	the	middle	and	long	tail	of
influencers.	So	if	my	brand	were	really	attractive	to	tweens	and	young	teens,	I
would	spend	40	percent	of	my	overall	marketing	budget	on	Musical.ly,	and	40–
70	percent	of	that	amount	directly	on	arranging	deals	with	Musical.ly	celebrities.
The	rest	I	would	use	to	experiment	with	programmatic	auction	ads.	Then	I’d
watch	closely	to	see	which	performed	better,	adjusting	as	I	go.
Musical.ly	 is	 the	 perfect	 place	 for	 a	 performance-oriented	 person	 to	 sell	 a
performance,	but	it’s	also	a	place	where	a	performance-oriented	person	can	sell
pencils,	or	açaí	juice,	or	fidget	spinners.	An	artist	could	make	a	video	of	himself

painting	or	drawing,	set	to	music.	A	writer	can	make	a	video	that	evokes	her
mood	for	the	day.	I	make	inspirational	and	motivational	memes	out	of	larger
pieces	 of	 pillar	 content;	 my	 best	 hits	 have	 been	 made	 by	 clipping	 a	 word	 or
phrase	 from	 one	 of	 my	 rants	 and	 setting	 it	 to	music.	 Wanna	 hear	 me	 speak
Russian?	Check	out	my	“Hustle”	Musical.ly	video.	Also,	see	how	I	managed	to
link	 my	 ALS	 ice-bucket	challenge	 to	 Gwen	 Stefani’s	 “The	 Sweet	 Escape.”
That’s	probably	the	best	singing	I	ever	did	in	my	life.
Creative	people	can	be	creative	anywhere,	and	the	most	creative	people	do	it
where	no	one	else	has	tried	before.	More	often	than	not,	people	who	produce
content	for	people	like	themselves	often	hit	their	mark	better	than	people	who
are	one	step	away	from	their	audience.	I	do	well	with	alpha	guys	because	I	have
alpha	male	DNA.	I’m	also	hugely	empathetic,	so	I	can	also	deeply	connect	with
emotionally	 intelligent	 people	 who	 are	 patient	 enough	 to	 get	 past	 the	 alpha
DNA.	 A	 dancer	 intuitively	 knows	 how	to	 produce	 content	 for	 other	 dancers;
someone	who	has	transformed	his	life	through	self-development	knows	how	to
reach	others	seeking	a	similar	epiphany.	Your	creativity	will	be	the	variable	to
your	success	on	this	platform—and	any	other.
Imagine	This
Let’s	say	that	after	working	for	years	as	a	professional	 singer	 and	 actor,	 you
decided	that	you	were	done	pursuing	stardom	and	made	the	choice	instead	to
take	 over	 your	 family’s	 summer	 camp,	 located	 in	 the	 woods	 just	 outside	 the
limits	 of	 your	 hometown.	This	 is	 an	 exciting	 move.	 Imagine,	 you	 are	 finally
going	to	stay	in	a	home	long	enough	to	invest	in	some	real	furniture	and	get	a
dog.	And	you	aren’t	leaving	the	industry	entirely;	you	plan	to	add	more	acting
and	 musical	 theater	 classes	 to	 the	 camp	so	 you	 can	 continue	 to	 share	 your
passion	and	expertise.	You	smile	as	you	imagine	the	all-camp	variety	show	at	the
end	of	each	summer	session.
Unfortunately,	you	didn’t	take	over	a	thriving	business.	While	once	yours	was
one	of	the	only	camps	of	this	kind	in	town,	over	the	last	decade	or	so,	several
more	have	been	established	here	and	in	surrounding	areas,	and	business	has	gone
down.	In	 particular,	 summer	 camp	 registrations	 are	 nowhere	 near	 where	 you
think	they	should	be.	Once	you	had	to	drop	a	session	because	too	few	children
enrolled.	 You’ve	 tried	 everything	 you	 can	 think	 of	 to	 grow	 the	 business,	 but
compared	to	the	newer,	fancier	options	to	choose	from,	your	camp	seems	a	little
nerdy	and	old-fashioned.

While	you’re	hanging	out	with	your	eleven-year-old	niece	one	day,	she	shows
you	a	video	of	herself	lip-syncing.	It’s	the	weirdest	thing	you’ve	ever	seen—a
fifteen-second	 closeup	 clip	 in	 which	 your	 niece	 bops	 around,	 sometimes
backward,	making	duck	faces	and	shooting	hand	signals	to	Kesha’s	“Praying.”
It’s	like	an	excerpt	from	a	music	video.	You	ask	if	her	mom	knows	she’s	playing
around	on	a	site	where	anyone	can	see	her.	“Sure,”	your	niece	replies.	“All	of	my
friends	are	on	it.	It’s	just	a	place	to	sing	and	dance.”
A	social-media	platform	embraced	by	eleven-year-olds	who	love	to	sing	and
dance.	What’s	this	thing	called	again?
You	set	up	a	Musical.ly	account	and	start	filming	yourself	performing	your
favorite	songs.	You	ask	your	campers	to	help	you	pick	the	song,	and	you	let
them	direct	you.	They’re	impressed—for	an	old	person,	you	don’t	look	or	sound
half	bad	when	singing	their	music.	(For	the	record,	you’re	thirty-five.)	You’re
not	even	lip-syncing,	you’re	the	real	deal,	straight	up.	You	create	micro–music
videos	that	not	only	showcase	your	talent,	but	also	the	camp.	You	film	from	a
different	location	every	day—the	boathouse,	the	pagoda,	the	archery	field,	the
arts	and	crafts	pavilion,	and	of	course,	the	amphitheater.
One	of	the	girls	asks	if	she	can	film	herself	with	your	phone.	You	send	home	a
permission	slip	asking	parents’	consent	to	let	the	kids	make	Musical.ly	videos	on
the	camp	account.	They	know	their	children	are	already	there,	and	most	agree.
From	then	on,	every	day,	a	new	camper	gets	to	produce	four	pieces	of	content	for
the	camp	Musical.ly	account.	Kids	are	fighting	for	their	chance	to	be	Muser	of
the	 Day;	 it	 becomes	 the	 biggest	 reward	 they	 can	 get,	 and	 all	 the	 kids	 start
working	extra	hard	to	be	helpful	to	earn	their	time.	There’s	an	added	benefit	to
letting	the	kids	control	your	platform:	it’s	a	great	learning	strategy.	Instead	of
figuring	out	for	yourself	what	kids	want	to	see	on	Musical.ly,	you	let	the	nine-to-
eleven-year-olds	 show	you.	 You	 now	 get	 to	 watch	 them,	 take	 note	 of	 their
behaviors,	and	get	a	sense	of	how	they	think	about	hashtags	and	trending	topics.
Again	 with	 the	 parents’	 permission,	 you	 let	 the	 kids	 document	 their	 camp
Olympics,	scavenger	hunt,	final	campfire,	and	all	the	camp	traditions	that	have
marked	the	summers	for	three	generations.
Every	child	who	makes	a	Musical.ly	video	immediately	tags	his	or	her	friends
so	 they	 can	 see	 it.	 The	 kids	 also	 show	 it	 to	their	 parents	 and	 their	 parents’
friends.	They	show	it	off	at	school	when	classes	start	again	in	the	fall.	Over	the
course	of	 the	 year,	 awareness	 of	 your	 Musical.ly	 page	 and	 the	 camp	 slowly
begins	 to	 rise.	 By	 spring,	 when	 parents	 start	 thinking	about	 which	 camps	 to
register	their	children	for,	the	name	of	your	camp	is	fresh	in	their	minds.	You
seal	the	deal	when	the	kids	inform	their	parents	that	they’ve	all	decided	they
want	to	attend	camp	together	during	the	same	session.

You	 become	 the	 most	 popular,	 fun,	 hip	 camp	 director	 ever,	 and	 your
popularity	 soars,	 along	 with	 awareness	 of	 the	 camp	 you	run.	 Registrations
double,	and	your	performing	arts	classes	are	so	popular	you	start	to	offer	them
during	 the	 rest	 of	 the	year.	 You	 initiate	 a	 music	 video	 class,	 which	 includes
teaching	the	kids	the	steps	to	famous	music	video	routines.	Within	five	to	eight
years,	the	camp	is	just	one	of	the	summer	options	available	through	your	new
city-based	 school	 for	 performing	arts.	 You’re	 a	 smaller	 star	 than	 you’d	 once
hoped	to	be,	but	you’ve	never	been	happier.
How	I’m	Crushing	It
Chithra	Durgam,	DDS,	Aesthetic	Dental
IG:	drdurgam
Dr.	Chithra	Durgam	has	accomplished	the	near	impossible—
she’s	made	it	fun	to	go	to	the	dentist.	How	else	can	you	explain
the	fact	that	many	of	her	first-time	clients	call	her	at	the	request
of	their	children?	Let	me	explain.
When	 Chithra	 started	 her	 private	 practice	 in	 2004,	 she	 did
what	most	medical	practitioners	do	to	get	referrals:	she	sent	out
direct-mail	 pieces	 to	 let	 her	 northern	 New	 Jersey	 neighbors
know	she	was	open	for	business.	Social	media,	she	thought,	was
for	personal	use.	It	wasn’t	until	she	started	following	a	social-
media	expert	online,	and	then	read	his	book	Crush	It!,	that	her
thinking	 shifted	 and	 she	 understood	 how	 building	 a	 personal
brand	 on	 social	 media	 could	 help	 grow	 a	 business.	 She	was
intrigued	 but	 hesitated	 to	 start.	 Doctors	 and	 dentists	 are
constrained	by	a	lot	of	HIPAA	rules,	and	“we	tend	to	be	overly
concerned	 about	 what	 each	 other	 thinks	 about	 the	 marketing
we’re	doing.”	But	she	gave	it	a	lot	of	thought	and	decided	that
“instead	of	using	my	free	time	to	go	golfing,	if	I’m	using	that
time	to	interact	with	my	patients,	and	educate	people	in	a	fun
way	 about	 dentistry,	 there	 can’t	 be	 anything	 wrong	 with	 that.
And	so	I	kind	of	just	took	a	leap	of	faith.”
For	 years,	 she	 has	 spent	 four	 to	 five	 hours	 every	 day,	 her
lunch	hour	and	the	time	she	has	after	her	two	boys	go	to	bed,	on

social	 media,	 engaging,	 reacting,	 and	 educating.	 She	 has	 a
presence	 on	 all	 the	 usual	 suspects—Twitter,	 Facebook,
Instagram,	and	she	has	written	posts	for	Medium—but	what	sets
Chithra	apart	from	almost	anyone	over	the	age	of	twenty-five,
and	 certainly	 from	 any	 medical	 practitioner,	is	 that	 she’s	 on
Musical.ly,	too.	And	that’s	why	so	many	kids	beg	their	parents
to	bring	them	to	see	her.
She	 creates	 lip-synced	 music	 videos	 about	 different
procedures,	like	tooth	whitening.	She	does	PSA	announcements
about	healthy	eating,	mouthing	the	words	of	a	spoof	version	of
Ed	 Sheeran’s	 “Shape	 of	 You.”	 Sometimes	 she	 posts	 an
educational	clip,	like	the	one	pointing	out	the	difference	between
a	porcelain	crown	and	a	veneer.	She	dances.	She	does	comedy,
often	in	a	white	jacket,	sometimes	wielding	a	toothbrush.	She’s
goofy	and	awkward,	and	while	that	might	be	all	she	was,	were
she	just	another	muser,	the	fact	that	she’s	a	forty-four-year-old
dentist	makes	the	whole	deal	pretty	hilarious.	The	comments	and
responses	she	 gets	 from	 the	 young	 users	 there	 are
overwhelmingly	positive,	and	two	of	her	clips	were	featured	by
the	platform.	Her	young	patients,	the	ones	in	the	Musical.ly	age
bracket,	follow	her.	They	bring	their	phones	to	school	and	show
their	friends.	And	their	friends	say,	“Mom,	look	at	this	video.	I
want	to	go	to	this	dentist.”
Chithra	 gets	 a	 similar	 response	 from	 Snapchat,	 where	 she
creates	content	tailored	for	a	slightly	older	crowd.	There	she	has
a	 weekly	 series	 called	 The	 Office,	 modeled	 after	 the	 hit
television	show	of	the	same	name.	She	and	members	of	her	staff
have	also	staged	scenes	from	Charlie’s	Angels	and	created	snaps
and	stories	using	Bitmojis,	music,	and	props.	She	used	to	try	to
document,	 but	 her	 audience	 responded	 so	positively	 to	 her
creative	work	that	now	she	focuses	on	that	instead.
Many	of	the	people	who	find	her	on	Musical.ly	and	Snapchat
can’t	come	to	her	office	because	they	live	too	far	away,	but	on
Instagram,	where	she	can	target	more	locally,	she	has	a	higher
conversion	rate;	people	DM	her	for	appointments	all	the	time.	In
the	 year	 since	 she	 got	 serious	 about	 pumping	 out	 consistent,
quality	 content	 to	 these	 three	 platforms	 in	 addition	 to	 all	the
others,	not	just	every	so	often,	she	has	seen	a	30	percent	increase
in	 new	 patients,	 with	 three	 to	 four	 inquiries	 about	braces	 and

whitening	procedures	per	day	coming	in	via	DM.
Not	only	that,	Lew	Leone,	vice	president	and	general	manager
of	WNYW-FOX	5,	saw	her	on	Snapchat	and	invited	her	to	come
to	Good	Day	New	York	to	talk	about	flossing	after	an	Associated
Press	 report	 published	 that	 it	 may	 be	 unnecessary.	 For	 the
record,	Dr.	Durgam	is	pro-flossing.
Since	 then	 she’s	 been	 invited	 to	 speak	 about	 personal
branding	at	meetings	and	on	podcasts.	She	is	currently	working
with	different	 brands	 to	 help	 them	 develop	 ideas	 to	 promote
their	 products	 through	 social	 media,	 and	 she	 has	 received
inquiries	from	other	dentists	and	doctors	asking	her	for	social-
media	consults,	too.	“I	have	taken	time	to	learn	all	aspects	of
developing	a	brand	before	pursuing	this	work.	I	understand	that
I	do	have	something	valuable	to	offer.”
Most	of	her	professional	colleagues	still	don’t	get	it.
I’ve	actually	gotten	a	lot	of	pushback	from	people	and	other	businesses.
They	want	a	return	on	their	efforts	right	away;	they	don’t	 understand
why	I’m	investing	time.	They	don’t	understand	that	social	media	is	a
long	game	and	that	it’s	about	developing	a	brand	as	much	as	it	is	about
selling	a	product.	And	if	nothing	else,	at	least	you	develop	rapport	with
people	who	come	to	your	business.	But	they	don’t	really	see	that.	So	it’s
been	a	little	lonely	because	I’m	doing	work	that	I	believe	in	even	though
those	people	around	me	may	not	agree	with	my	methods.
Even	some	of	her	clients	wonder	how	she	has	time	to	put	out
so	many	videos.	“And	then	I’ll	have	to	say,	my	staff	and	I	are
very	serious	about	our	work,	but	when	we’re	not	working,	we
would	rather	spend	our	free	time	interacting	with	patients	and
educating	them,	as	opposed	to	doing	something	that’s	only	in
our	 self-interest.	 Once	 I’ve	 explained	 our	 intention,	 it’s	 been
fine.	I’m	kind	of	going	against	everybody	else	right	now,	but	I
think	 over	 time	 people	 will	 understand	 social	 media	 is	 very
important	to	business.”
One	of	the	reasons	I’m	so	excited	about	this	book	is	because
when	I	wrote	Crush	It!,	I	didn’t	have	access	to	a	lot	of	examples
of	other	people	using	the	platforms	the	way	I	was.	I	was	just	too
early.	But	now,	armed	with	stories	like	Chithra’s,	I	can	suffocate
all	of	your	excuses.	Until	ten	minutes	ago,	you	might	not	have
even	heard	of	Musical.ly;	now	you	know	that	a	dentist	is	out
there	using	it	and	other	platforms	to	build	her	business.	That’s

awesome!	Education	 and	 execution	 are	 the	 keys	 to	 this	 new
world.

Snapchat
Despite	 its	 173	 million	 daily	 active	 users	 (DAU),	 its	 10	 billion	 daily	 video
views,	its	2.5	billion	daily	snaps,	and	the	approximately	18	visits	it	enjoys	from
its	DAU	per	day,
1
	Snapchat	remains	another	massively	underestimated	platform.
Let	me	clue	you	in	to	an	important	tell:	when	the	“normals,”	that	is,	the	nontech,
nonbusiness	crowd,	are	the	first	to	start	spending	inordinate	amounts	of	time	on
a	platform,	that’s	the	signal	to	start	paying	close	attention.	That’s	what	drew	me
to	Musical.ly	early	on,	and	it’s	why	I	knew	Snapchat	had	an	exciting	future	when
it	first	came	out	in	2011.	I	saw	it	as	the	first	social	network	to	closely	re-create
the	way	we	communicate	face-to-face.
Its	 founders,	 Evan	 Spiegel	 and	 Bobby	 Murphy,	 conceived	 it	 as	 the	 anti-
Facebook,	 a	 photo-sharing	 app	 for	 spontaneous,	 imperfect,	and	 impermanent
content.	When	Snapchat	first	came	on	the	scene	in	2011,	the	messaging	app’s
vertical	video	and	left-right	swiping	had	people	totally	confused.	It	took	most
users,	even	the	young,	a	few	minutes	to	click	around	and	get	used	to	it.	For
teens,	 though,	 it	 was	 worth	 figuring	 out,	 because	 it	 addressed	 two	 universal
adolescent	realities:	(1)	You	don’t	want	to	hang	where	you	mom	hangs	out,	and
(2)	You	want	to	lock	your	room.	Because	adults	didn’t	get	it,	because	images
“self-destructed”	one	to	ten	seconds	after	being	opened,	and	because	it	gave	you
the	option	of	drawing	and	writing	text	or	captions	on	top	of	your	pictures,	the
kids	were	quick	to	see	its	potential	as	texting	2.0—a	freer,	less	curated,	and	less
dangerous	place	than	other	platforms	to	share	and	creatively	express	themselves.
And	share	they	did;	it	became	widely	derided	and	even	feared	as	the	next	sexting
tool	for	the	high	school	set	(though	it	never	really	was	a	sexting	app;	that	was

just	the	media	jumping	on	a	select	few	cases	and	running	with	the	attention-
grabbing	headlines).	Today	people	don’t	talk	about	sexting	and	Snapchat	in	the
same	breath	anymore,	just	as	people	stopped	sneering	at	Twitter	for	being	the
place	where	attention	hogs	posted	what	they	ate	for	lunch,	and	at	Facebook	for
being	a	place	where	college	students	shared	their	beer-pong	pics.
Today	the	Snapchat	app	allows	you	to	post	video	as	well	as	photos	and	has
added	all	kinds	of	extras,	like	filters,	Geofilters,	lenses,	emojis,	and	video-editing
tools	like	slo-mo.	Content	is	no	longer	ephemeral.	You	could	always	hack	by
taking	screenshots	of	images	to	save	them,	but	with	the	addition	of	Memories,
which	stores	your	content	on	the	app’s	servers,	Snapchat	essentially	caved	in	to
the	human	desire	to	save	and	revisit	the	important	moments	of	our	lives.	The
game-changing	introduction,	however,	and	the	one	that	would	turn	out	to	have
the	most	influence	on	influencers,	was	Stories,	a	function	that	allows	you	to	link
a	series	 of	 videos	 and	 photos	 to	 tell	 a	 longer	 narrative,	 visible	 to	 the	 whole
Snapchat	 community	 for	 twenty-four	 hours.	 It	arrived	 in	 2013,	 and	 I	 very
publicly	pronounced	it	a	dud.
You	 can	 watch	 me	 make	 my	 blunder	 emphatically	 and	 passionately	 at	 the
LeWeb’13	 conference	 on	 YouTube.	 I	 loved	 the	 platform,	but	 I	 thought	 the
change	introduced	too	much	friction	in	the	UI	and	betrayed	the	whole	point	of
the	app,	which	was	to	create	snack-size	disappearing	content.	I	was	dead	wrong.
The	Story	feature	became	the	main	place	where	users	could	consume	content	at
scale.	 Less	 than	 a	 year	 later,	 40	 percent	 of	 American	 teenagers	 were	 using
Snapchat	daily.	I	learned	an	important	lesson	from	that	bad	call	on	Snapchat:	a
devoted,	sticky	fan	base	is	willing	to	be	patient	as	you	experiment	your	way	to
the	next	iteration.	The	next	big	launch,	Discover,	saw	Snapchat	graduate	into	a
bona	fide	media	platform	by	offering	a	page	where	users	would	find	a	slew	of
brands	 like	 National	 Geographic,	 T-Mobile,	 and	 ESPN.	 Snapchat	 now	 had
access	to	advertising	revenue,	and	that	meant	so	did	anyone	who	could	crack	the
Snapchat	code.
The	man	who	did	that	is	named	DJ	Khaled,	but	before	I	introduce	him,	we’re
going	to	reminisce	about	Ashton	Kutcher.	He	wasn’t	the	first	star	on	Twitter—
big	shout-out	to	MC	Hammer	(joined	in	May	2007)	and	LeVar	Burton	(joined	in
December	 2008)—but	 after	joining	 in	 January	 2009,	 Kutcher	 was	 the	 first
celebrity	to	truly	scale	his	brand	through	the	platform.	Like	Hammer	and	Burton,
he’d	been	building	his	brand	through	talent	and	hustle	for	decades	as	a	model,	a
sitcom	 and	 film	 actor,	 and	 a	 producer	 and	director	 for	 the	 reality-TV	 show
Punk’d.	 I	 often	 talk	 about	 Kutcher	 when	 I	 talk	 about	 the	 history	 of	 Twitter,
because	it	was	only	four	months	after	joining	that	he	became	the	first	Twitter
user	to	boast	one	million	followers,	thanks	to	a	brilliant	campaign	of	challenging

CNN	to	a	race	to	hit	the	milestone.	Suddenly	Twitter,	which	had	seemed	like	a
joke	to	most	people,	was	mainstream.
DJ	Khaled	created	the	Ashton	Kutcher	moment	for	Snapchat.	For	over	two
decades,	he	built	a	name	for	himself	in	the	music	industry	as	a	Miami-based	DJ,
producer,	and	radio	host.	Khaled	joined	Snapchat	in	the	fall	of	2015,	snapping
inspirational	and	motivational	“keys”	to	life	and	success.	His	fondness	for	the
platform,	he	wrote	in	his	memoir,	The	Keys,	was	that,	“It’s	not	about	the	angle	or
editing	or	lighting	or	how	good	you	look,	it’s	just	you	for	ten	seconds	being	real
with	 your	 fans.”
2
	 That	 authenticity	 had	 earned	 him	 a	 sizable	 fan	 base.	 By
November	or	December	of	that	year,	anyone	following	social	media	could	see
that	whatever	it	was	he	was	doing,	it	was	something	special.	Thousands	of	kids
were	showing	up	to	meet	his	bus	in	places	like	Des	Moines,	Iowa.	You	could
start	to	feel	that	the	scale	of	Snapchat	was	shifting.	Then,	in	December	of	that
year,	Khaled	left	a	friend’s	house	by	jet	ski,	only	to	get	caught	off	guard	by	the
waning	 early-winter	 light.	 Disoriented	in	 the	 now	 pitch-black	 water,	 he
proceeded	to	snap	his	entire	ordeal	until	he	finally	made	it	back	to	shore.	By	the
next	 day,	his	 popularity—and	 his	 personal	 brand—had	 exploded.	 DJ	 Khaled
made	it	official:	Snapchat	was	now	a	star-making	vehicle.
So	how	did	Khaled	do	it?	How	does	a	grown-up	become	famous	on	a	platform
that	 serves	 as	 a	 communication	 tool	 among	 tweens	and	 teens?	 By	 not
overthinking	anything.	Unpolished	content	is	native	to	Snapchat,	and	Khaled	just
was	who	he	was.	Some	people	might	call	such	banal,	spontaneous	content	dumb
and	worthless,	but	that	would	be	like	saying	that	the	minutiae	of	our	lives	are
dumb	 and	 worthless.	 They’re	 not.	 When	 combined,	 those	 raw,	 unfiltered
moments	make	up	who	we	are.	We	don’t	judge	mundane	behavior	as	dumb	when
we	interact	with	people;	we	save	such	judgment	for	truly	dumb	behavior.	We
accept	people	in	their	natural	habitats,	and	we	understand	that	every	word	people
utter	is	not	going	to	be	movie	script–worthy.	Snapchat	is	simply	a	channel	that
captures	that	unvarnished	reality.	The	only	reason	some	people	think	what	gets
shared	there	is	dumb	is	because	it’s	on	a	screen,	and	we’ve	been	conditioned	to
think	that	anything	on	a	screen	has	to	be	perfectly	produced	and	performed.	On
Twitter	we’re	expected	to	be	clever	or	politically	astute	and	insightful.	Facebook
is	 where	 we	 show	 off	 our	 families	 and	 vacations.	On	 Instagram	 we	 build
relationships	through	images	and	short	videos.	Snapchat,	though,	is	where	we
put	our	throwaway	content.	It’s	 a	 relief	 to	 many	 because	 it	 demands	 little	 of
either	its	content	creators	or	users.	It	eliminated	the	great	barrier	to	many	social
networks,	which	is	the	anxiety	of	wondering	what	you’re	going	to	post	next,
whether	it	will	be	well	received,	and	whether	it	could	come	back	to	haunt	you

one	day.	With	the	freedom	to	post	anything,	people	could	experiment	and	get
comfortable	building	their	personal	brands	without	fear	of	repercussions.	That
opened	 the	 floodgates	 for	 many	 to	 unleash	 their	 creativity	and	 discover	 and
develop	new	skills.	More	than	one	person	has	left	a	corporate	job	or	fledgling
startup	because	playing	around	on	Snapchat	led	them	to	create	a	new	art	medium
or	 become	 an	 influencer,	 which	 attracted	 brands	 eager	 to	 pay	 them	 tens	 of
thousands	of	dollars	to	promote	their	products	in	Snapchat	Stories.
It	is	staggering	how	many	families	are	filming	their	days	and	building	actual
fame.	It’s	especially	easy	if	you’re	willing	to	include	your	children.	That’s	an
extremely	personal	choice,	but	babies	and	cute	animals	always	win,	hands	down.
Kerry	Robinson	learned	that	when	she	used	Snapchat	to	film	herself	engaging	in
#salontalk	with	her	baby	girl,	Jayde,	while	Jayde	took	to	her	mom’s	hair	with	a
brush.	 Her	 Stories	 on	 Facebook	 went	 viral	 and	 garnered	 articles	 and	 TV
segments	in	national	media,	from	CBS	News	to	Essence	magazine.	Today	Jayde
has	 her	 own	 ad-supported	 YouTube	 channel	 with	 seventy-four	 thousand
subscribers	 and	 an	 Instagram	 account	with	 more	 than	 two	 hundred	 thousand
followers.	You	can	watch	a	video	of	her	opening	a	gift	of	children’s	products
from	a	hair	care	company	and	see	a	photo	that	expresses	thanks	for	a	T-shirt	sent
by	a	company	that	celebrates	children	with	naturally	curly	hair.	You	couldn’t	get
a	purer	example	of	a	person	who	is	famous—and,	it	would	seem,	earning	money
—for	simply	being	herself.	That’s	what	can	come	from	posting	a	single	piece	of
excellent	content.	What	will	come	of	Jayde’s	online	celebrity	in	the	long	term
remains	to	be	seen,	of	course,	but	at	a	time	when	people	are	desperate	for	good
news	and	uplifting,	heartwarming	content,	a	glimpse	of	your	ordinary	life	could
be	just	what	they’re	looking	for.
Many	people	who	have	already	gotten	some	brand	traction	and	are	becoming
influencers,	including	some	featured	in	this	book,	stopped	producing	content	on
Snapchat	as	soon	as	Instagram	Stories	came	out	in	August	2016.	The	thinking
was	that	Snapchat	is	toast.	Why	bother?
You	bother	because	it’s	a	mistake	to	give	up	one	of	the	tools	in	your	tool	belt
for	no	reason.	Hear	this:	Instagram	and	Snapchat	are	not	the	same.	As	always,
people	are	looking	for	different	things	on	each.	Why	would	you	deprive	them?
Sure,	it’s	hard.	That’s	the	challenge.	But	that’s	also	the	opportunity.	Because	it’s
hard,	only	one	in	twenty	of	you	is	going	to	do	it	well.	You	should	be	busting
your	ass	to	be	that	one	in	twenty.	I	understand	that	you	want	to	focus	on	what	is
giving	you	the	best	returns	right	now,	but	what	if	it	doesn’t	always?	And	why
would	you	turn	your	back	on	a	potentially	whole	new	audience?
As	 I	 write	 this	 book,	 I’m	 constantly	 checking	 the	 App	 Store	 to	 see	 which
platforms	are	ranked	highest.	Snapchat	is	often	in	the	top	five.	That	means	it’s

not	an	irrelevant	platform,	and	no	influencer	is	too	good	for	it.
If	anything,	this	app	is	one	of	the	most	valuable	for	anyone	whose	brand	is
starting	to	scale.	Much	of	your	competition	has	surely	become	too	reliant	and
focused	on	Instagram,	which	means	those	potential	eyeballs	still	on	Snapchat	are
looking	for	more	content	to	feed	them.	Make	sure	you’re	the	one	to	deliver	it.	It
is	so	easy	for	influencers	to	become	sucked	into	the	vortex	of	the	media	machine
they’ve	 created.	 You	 risk	 becoming	 a	 caricature	 of	 yourself,	 especially	 on
Instagram,	where	the	images	 are	 so	 highly	 curated.	 As	 a	 feature	 within	 your
Instagram	ecosystem,	Instagram	Stories	are	almost	required	to	stay	within	the
lines	and	support	the	narrative	you’ve	created	there.	Snapchat,	on	the	other	hand,
is	an	entity	unto	its	own.	You	can	use	it	to	break	away	from	the	familiar	narrative
and	show	sides	of	yourself	that	simply	don’t	exist	anywhere	else.	It	gives	you
differentiated	 content.	 Whereas	 all	 your	 other	 channels	 intertwine	 with	 each
other	to	support	your	pillar	content,	Snapchat	stands	alone.	That’s	an	excellent
reason	in	and	of	itself	to	take	it	seriously,	even	when	its	DNA	makes	it	a	natural
draw	for	the	mundane	and	the	silly.	It	gives	you	a	place	to	be	surprising	and
different,	often	in	the	most	ordinary,	banal	ways.	(This	is	advice	I	should	take	to
heart,	too;	I	could	do	an	even	better	job	there	myself!)
Snapchat	101
Back	 to	 the	 original	 question:	 how	 should	 grown-ups	 build	 their	 brands	 and
dreams	on	a	communication	tool	for	tweens	and	teens?
Some	people,	like	baby	Jayde,	have	so	much	charisma	that	they’re	going	to	go
viral	 the	 minute	 they	 present	 themselves	 or	 their	work	 in	 public.	 But	 those
individuals	are	few.	For	the	vast	majority,	it	will	take	talent	plus	a	combination
of	tactics	and	strategy	to	get	noticed.	Yet	Snapchat	limits	those	tactics.	There	are
no	hashtags,	for	example,	so	no	discoverability.	What	that	means	is	that	building
a	 brand	 on	 Snapchat	 is	 truly	 a	 test	 of	 your	 branding	 prowess.	 It’s	 not	 about
running	ads	and	quantifying	every	click	and	mathematical	variable;	it’s	about
hacking	culture.	Snapchat	reveals	who’s	good	at	it	and	who’s	not.	This	is	why
you	shouldn’t	wonder	whether	to	bother	with	Snapchat	now	that	Instagram	has
its	own	version	of	Stories.	Whether	or	not	Snapchat	can	compete	over	time,	it’s	a
terrific	training	ground	to	become	a	superior	marketer	and	branding	expert,	not
just	a	conversion-based	digital	salesperson.
Let	me	say	that	again	another	way.	The	business	world	is	separated	into	two
camps,	conversion-based	salespeople	and	branding-and-marketing	people.	The

former	are	short-term	players;	the	latter,	long-term.	With	no	disrespect	meant
toward	sales,	I	always	try	to	teach	you	to	be	branding-and-marketing	people,
because	 the	 great,	 life-changing	 upside	 resides	 in	 long-term	 thinking,	 not	 in
figuring	out	how	to	make	a	quick	buck.	For	example,	Lauryn	Evarts,	creator	of
The	Skinny	Confidential,	takes	a	long-term	view	of	her	investment	in	Snapchat.
I	answer	every	single	snap	I	get,	and	sometimes	I	get	two	hundred	a	day.	I	sit	down	at	night	for
an	hour	and	in	the	morning	for	an	hour,	and	answer	every	single	question.	It’s	almost	like	text-
messaging	your	readers	like	they’re	your	friends.	I	think	it	allowed	people	to	really	come	into
my	life	and	allowed	me	to	come	into	theirs.	It’s	just	a	different	way	of	being	social.	And	it
allows	me	to	tell	a	story,	and	while	I	tell	that	story,	I’m	100	percent	providing	value	to	the
audience.
For	instance,	if	I	go	to	cryotherapy,	I	take	a	picture	of	where	I	am,	and	then	I	show	me	in	the
booth	freezing	my	ass	off.	And	then	I	can	show	what	I	wore,	and	after	that,	I	Snapchat	the
little	flier	with	the	benefits.	So	what	my	followers	get	out	of	that	is	where	to	go,	what	the
benefits	are,	what	they	should	wear,	and	what	it	looks	like	when	you’re	in	the	chamber.	With
every	single	thing	I	do,	I	try	to	hit	those	four	points.	I’m	not	just	going	to	post	a	picture	of	my
coffee	cup.	I’m	going	to	say,	“Today,	I’m	drinking	iced	coffee.	I’m	drinking	it	with	a	silicone
straw	because	it’s	BPA	free,	and	I	like	cinnamon	in	it	because	it	helps	with	your	blood	sugar.”
Every	single	snap	needs	to	leave	them	with	something	or	else	it’s	narcissistic.
With	Instagram	Stories,	you’re	competing	with	a	lot	of	people.	Snapchat	has	white	noise,
and	whenever	I	see	white	noise,	I’m	intrigued,	because	that’s	the	way	to	stand	out.	Some	of
these	influencers	have	just	been	taking	pictures	for	the	last	five	years.	Snapchat	forces	you	to
show	your	personality.	Are	you	intelligent,	are	you	funny?	What	are	you	bringing	to	the	table
other	than	what	you’re	wearing?
The	thing	to	remember	is	that	no	one	is	famous	only	on	Snapchat.	Because	of
the	temporary	nature	of	the	majority	of	the	content,	the	only	way	to	allow	it	to
live	long	enough	for	people	to	discover	and	get	to	know	you	is	to	cross-pollinate
with	other	platforms.	For	example,	if	you	missed	DJ	Khaled’s	jet	ski	drama,	you
can	still	find	it	on	YouTube.	Same	with	Kerry	and	Jayde	Robinson’s	salon	talk.
That	means	that	to	be	a	Snapchat	influencer,	you	need	to	be	strong	on	the	other
platforms	 as	 well.	 The	 content	you	 produce	 for	 Snapchat	 has	 to	 be	 powerful
enough	to	draw	views	on	YouTube,	Facebook,	and	Instagram.
The	way	to	get	discovered	on	Snapchat	is	not	much	different	from	the	way
television	 stations	 try	 to	 get	 people	 to	 tune	 in	to	 their	 programs,	 which	 is	 to
market	in	all	the	other	places	where	people	who	might	be	interested	in	you	are
already	 going.	That’s	 what	 I	 did.	 I	 was	 never	 concerned	 by	 the	 lack	 of
discoverability	on	Snapchat,	because	I	could	see	that	all	I	had	to	do	was	draw
awareness	to	it	through	my	base	on	Twitter,	YouTube,	and	my	website.	I	did	not
use	tactics	like	running	Facebook	ads	to	convert	people.	Instead,	I	branded	and
marketed.	You’ll	be	in	the	minority	if	you’re	able	to	figure	out	a	formula	that
works	equally	well	across	platforms—most	people	lean	heavily	on	the	one	or
two	 they’re	 most	 comfortable	 with—and	 that	 rare	skill	 could	 make	 you	 a

dominant	force	here.
All	 you’re	 doing	 when	 testing	 discovery	 strategies	 is	 figuring	 out	 how	 to
siphon	people’s	attention.	For	example,	if	you	want	to	bring	awareness	to	your
Snapchat	profile	and	you	send	out	lots	of	e-mails,	add	your	snapcode	to	the	e-
mail.	Pretty	easy,	right?	You	could	wear	a	T-shirt	with	your	snapcode	printed	on
it,	 or	 you	 could	 create	 custom	 Geofilters,	 which	 are	 still	 underpriced.*	 Both
tactics	would	allow	you	to	put	your	brand	right	in	front	of	people’s	eyes	in	a	fun,
interactive,	unobtrusive	way.
Snapchat	201
Collaborate.	There	is	no	discoverability	on	Snapchat;	people	have	to	know	who
you	 are	 and	 be	 motivated	 to	 come	 find	 you	 and	follow	 you.	 That	 makes
organizing	collaborations	tricky	unless	you	reach	out	to	people	on	their	other
platforms—their	 e-mail,	their	 Instagram,	 whatever—and	 either	 suggest	 doing
something	special	together	on	Snapchat	or	offer	something	valuable	in	return	for
a	shout-out	or	endorsement	on	their	channel.	If	you	need	other	influencers	to
help	 you	 grow	 your	 account,	 you’re	 probably	not	 big	 enough	 to	 be	 of	 much
interest	to	them	unless	you’ve	got	something	pretty	spectacular	up	your	sleeve.
Here	are	some	ideas	for	growing	your	followers	to	build	your	brand	and	make
yourself	more	attractive	for	collabs:
Write	multiple	blog	posts	about	Snapchat,	so	when	the	media	need	a
quote	about	it,	they	come	to	you.
Gain	visibility	by	creating	Snapchat	events,	such	as	the	Jurasnap	Park
project	that	helped	launch	the	career	of	Shonduras.
Pay	for	a	Google	Ad	that	asks	something	like	“Who	Should	I	Follow	on
Snapchat?”	and	offers	a	list	of	names,	with	yours	at	the	top.
One	more	suggestion:	you	could	visit	The11thsecond.com,	a	website	founded
by	 Cyrene	 Quiamco,	 also	 known	 as	 CyreneQ,	 snapchat	artist	 and	 influencer
extraordinaire.	She	created	the	website	in	response	to	the	app’s	lack	of	discovery.
There	you	can	submit	and	check	out	Snapchatter	descriptions	and	user	names	to
make	 it	 easier	 for	 users	 to	 find	 accounts	 that	 match	 your	 interests,	like
Meowchickenfish,	 who	 uses	 Snapchat	 art	 to	 teach	 sign	 language,	 and
Snapchatchef,	who	makes	cooking	videos.	The	site	is	a	screenshot	repository	for
cool	Snapchat	art,	as	well	as	a	resource	where	Snapchatters	can	look	for	tips,

hacks,	 inspiration,	advice,	 and	 more.	 CyreneQ	 saw	 a	 problem—no	 discovery
option	on	her	favorite	platform—and	solved	it.	Like	all	good	entrepreneurs,	she
found	a	way.
Imagine	This
Let’s	 say	 you’re	 like	 me,	 a	 forty-two-year-old	 influencer	 who	 has	 become
somewhat	pigeonholed	in	terms	of	the	kind	of	content	that’s	expected	of	you.
You	already	have	a	blog,	a	Q&A	show,	and	a	daily	vlog.	While	playing	around
on	 Snapchat,	 you	 realize	that	 it	 could	 provide	 you	 with	 an	 interesting	 outlet
where	 you	 could	 create	 a	 new	 narrative,	 a	 place	 to	 microvlog.	 It’s	 the	place
where	you	can	talk	about	your	coffee,	show	a	picture	of	the	colorful	cereal	aisle
at	 your	 supermarket,	 and	 reveal	 that	your	favorite	 color	 marker	 is	 green.	 It’s
where	Rick	the	clothing	store	manager	snaps	himself	playing	Wiffle	Ball	with
friends,	and	 where	 Sally	 the	 real	 estate	 agent	 admits	 that	 even	 though	 she’s

How	I’m	Crushing	It
Shaun	McBride,	Shonduras
IG:@shonduras
It’s	no	secret	that	I	think	spending	four	years	getting	a	college
degree	if	you	have	your	heart	set	on	becoming	a	businessperson
or	entrepreneur	is	a	waste	of	time	and	money.
Make	 that	 a	fucking	 waste	 of	 time	 and	 money.	 I	 feel	 that
strongly	about	it.
However,	I	 am	 grateful	 to	 Weber	 State	 University	 in	 Utah,
because	 that’s	 where	 Shaun	 McBride	 received	Crush	It!	as	 a
reading	 assignment	 from	 one	 of	 his	 professors	 in	 2010.	 If	 he
hadn’t,	it	might	have	been	a	few	more	years	before	we	finally

heard	of	him.	The	timing,	however,	put	Shaun	in	a	position	to
become	a	mega-influencer.	And	he	did	it	on	a	platform	where
most	people	said	it	couldn’t	be	done.
Shaun	 embodies	 the	 work-hard–work-smart	 model.	 At	 the
time	that	he	was	getting	his	degree,	Shaun	was	also	running	a
skate/snowboard	shop.	It	made	sense;	until	then,	skateboarding
had	 been	 his	 main	 joy	 in	 life.	 His	 other	 love	 was	 motivating
people	and	sharing	positivity.	He’d	spent	two	years	on	a	service
mission	 in	 Honduras—that’s	 how	 he	 got	 his	 nickname,
Shonduras—where	 he	 had	 been	moved	 by	 his	 experience
serving	others	and	helping	make	a	difference	in	their	lives.	The
skate	shop	was	an	ideal	place	for	him	to	share	his	love	for	sport
and	 service.	 Problem	 was,	 while	 he	 liked	 the	 work,	 it	 wasn’t
always	much	fun.	He	knew	he	wanted	to	build	a	business,	and
he	knew	his	passion	was	skateboarding,	but	he	had	a	suspicion
that	building	a	business	around	that	passion	could	be	a	great	way
to	 ensure	 that	 he	 rarely	 got	 to	 indulge	 in	 it,	 like	 the	 music
teacher	 and	 his	 neglected	 symphony	in	Mr.	 Holland’s	 Opus.
“You	can	kill	your	passions.	On	a	very	good	snow	day,	I	was	in
the	 shop	 because	 everyone	 needed	 to	 buy	 gear	 to	 go
snowboarding.	I	think	it’s	often	best	to	chase	things	that	are	in
line	with	your	passions	but	aren’t	exactly	your	passion.”
Upon	reading	Crush	It!,	he	applied	some	of	what	he	learned
to	his	in-store	customer	service,	but	more	significant,	the	book
made	him	realize	that	if	he	went	about	it	creatively,	he	might	be
able	to	build	an	e-commerce	business	that	would	allow	him	to
have	fun	every	day	doing	something	he	loved.	He	didn’t	know
anything	about	e-commerce,	but	he	figured	the	best	way	to	learn
was	to	just	go	for	it.	What	could	he	sell	online	that	would	also
allow	him	to	interact	regularly	with	people?	His	first	thought,	of
course,	was	skateboards	and	snowboards.	But	snowboards	need
a	lot	of	storage	and	are	costly	to	ship	and	hard	to	buy	in	bulk.
They	were	his	passion,	but	they	were	not	a	practical	choice.	So
what	was	small,	lightweight,	and	easy	to	buy	in	bulk?
Jewelry.
Who	bought	jewelry?
Moms.
And	where	were	moms	hanging	out?
Facebook.

At	 the	 time,	 Facebook	 was	 still	 in	 the	 early	 stages	 of	 its
gargantuan	 growth,	 adding	 millions	 of	 users	 every	 month,
women	leading	 the	 way	 to	 make	 up	 57	 percent	 of	 the	 site
membership	and	accounting	for	62	percent	of	the	shares.

	And
Facebook	had	all	these	features	that	could	enhance	engagement.
For	 example,	 if	 one	 person	 commented	 on	 a	 post,	 all	 their
friends	could	see	it!	It’s	hard	to	remember,	but	at	the	time	that
was	still	pretty	remarkable.
Facebook	became	Shaun’s	storefront	and	his	design	studio.
“I	 would	 ask	 my	 fans	 to	 tell	 me	 what	 kind	 of	 styles	 they
wanted	 and	 help	 me	 name	 the	 pieces.	 I’d	 do	 giveaways	 like,
‘Whoever	picks	the	best	name	for	this	necklace	will	get	ten	free
necklaces.’”	Engagement	went	through	the	roof.	He	gave	people
every	opportunity	to	interact	with	the	site.	“It	felt	like	they	were
part	 of	 the	 jewelry	 boutique	 and	 that	 we	 were	 creating	 it
together.”
No	 one	 was	 more	 surprised	 by	 the	 venture’s	 success	 than
Shaun.
“I	 didn’t	 even	 think	 it	 was	 going	 to	 work.	 I	 was	 hoping	 I
could	make	fifty	bucks	a	week	extra	by	shipping	a	couple	of
necklaces	out	 of	 the	 back	 of	 my	 skate	 shop.	 And	 within	 one
week,	I	had	more	orders	than	I	could	handle.	Within	two	weeks,
I’d	hired	all	my	sisters,	and	I	was	paying	them	with	necklaces.”
It	took	only	two	months	to	net	six	figures.
He	quickly	hired	more	help,	and	by	the	end	of	the	first	year,
the	business	had	made	$1.2	million.	But	Shaun	wasn’t	there	to
celebrate.	He	was	having	a	blast,	but	after	about	eight	months,
he	was	done.	His	excitement	for	the	business	was	rooted	in	the
steep	 learning	 curve;	 now	 that	 he’d	 learned	 everything	 he
needed	 to	 know,	 he	 was	 ready	 to	 see	 if	 he	 could	 apply	 that
knowledge	to	a	new	business,	one	that	traded	in	helping	brands
tell	stories	and	spread	positive	messages	via	social	media	rather
than	selling	 consumer	 goods.	 Shaun	 sold	 the	 business	 to	 his
partner	 and	 quit	 his	 day	 job	 at	 the	 retail	 shop,	 but	 instead	 of
immediately	starting	a	new	company,	he	accepted	a	dream	job	as
a	sales	rep	for	some	of	his	favorite	skateboard	and	snowboard
brands,	a	position	that	gave	him	plenty	of	opportunity	to	“shred”
as	much	as	he	liked.	It	also	bought	him	the	time	he	needed	to
study	the	market	and	figure	out	a	scalable,	long-term	business

idea.
The	job	required	that	he	travel	a	lot,	so	Shaun’s	high-school-
age	sisters	asked	him	to	 download	 a	 new	 app	 popular	 among
teens	called	 Snapchat	 to	 make	 it	 easier	 for	 him	 to	 share	 his
adventures	 with	 them.	 There	 it	 was:	 the	 answer	 he’d	 been
seeking.	At	the	time,	you	had	to	hold	your	finger	on	the	screen
or	 the	 image	 would	 disappear.	 That	 meant	 100	 percent
engagement.	 You	 could	draw	 cartoons	 and	 doodles	 on	 your
pictures	 with	 your	 finger,	 something	 you	 couldn’t	 do	 on	 any
other	platform.	That	meant	fun.	If	there’s	one	thing	Shaun	had
learned	from	his	jewelry-boutique	experiment,	it’s	that	he	was
good	 at	 creating	 safe	 online	communities	 where	 people	 could
come	together	to	engage	and	have	fun.
“The	greatest	challenge	was	trying	to	grow	on	a	platform	that
did	 not	 cater	 to	 growth.	 Snapchat	 was	 a	 communication
platform,	like	text	messaging,	so	I	had	to	make	it	into	a	content-
creating	 platform.	 Eventually,	 Snapchat	 made	 updates,	 which
helped	with	that,	but	I	had	to	get	creative	at	first.”
There’s	a	reason	Shaun’s	content	got	so	much	attention	when
so	many	others	on	Snapchat	did	not:	he	treated	Snapchat	like	a
business.	 Many	 people	 start	 pumping	 out	 cool	 content	 onto	 a
platform	 and	 just	 hope	 they’ll	 get	 noticed	 and	 grow	 their
audience	enough	 that	 brands	 will	 come	 calling.	 Usually	 you
have	to	be	more	proactive	than	that.	Shaun	had	a	plan.	He	set
himself	 a	series	 of	 goals,	 and	 everything	 he	 did	 from	 that
moment	was	in	service	of	meeting	them.
Goal	number	one	was	to	grow	an	audience	through	creative
engagement	 and	 collaborations,	 so	 he	 started	 doodling.	 Every
day	he	would	post	a	video	of	himself	doing	something	goofy	or
a	fun	picture	he’d	doctored	to	make	people	laugh,	like	a	unicorn
vomiting	rainbows	over	a	snowy	landscape	or	his	dachshunds	in
silly	costumes	and	poses.	He	also	invited	his	fans	to	participate
in	his	snaps.	For	example,	he	drew	himself	as	a	triceratops	and
announced	that	he	wanted	help	building	Jurasnap	Park,	posting
requests	 for	 friends	 to	 take	 selfies,	 draw	 themselves	 as
dinosaurs,	and	send	the	pictures	to	him.	He	took	screenshots	of
the	images	and	displayed	them.	The	response	was	tremendous.
“It	felt	like	one-to-one	communication.	On	a	lot	of	social	media,
you	make	a	beautiful	image,	and	then	people	comment	below.

Snapchat	 felt	 more	 collaborative.	 We	 built	 the	 stories	 up
together.”
Most	 people	 would	 naturally	 assume	 that	 it	 was	 Shaun’s
artistic	 abilities	 that	 drew	 him	 to	 the	 platform,	 but	 there’s
something	funny	about	the	way	he	drew	his	way	to	Snapchat
stardom.
I	 literally	 did	 not	 know	 how	 to	 draw.	 When	 I	 decided	 to	 make	 the
Snapchat	thing	work,	I	thought,	“Well,	if	I	want	to	tell	a	good	story,	and	I
think	this	is	a	great	platform	that’s	emerging,	a	lot	of	it	has	to	do	with
doodling	and	creativity,	I	need	 to	 learn.”	 I	 literally	 Googled	 “How	 to
draw	dinosaurs”	and	then	“How	do	I	do	angry	eyes?”	and	then	I’d	put
them	on	my	dinosaur.	I	never	copied	anything,	but	I	would	teach	myself
how	to	draw	by	looking	up	art	on	the	Internet,	and	then	I	slowly	learned
how	to	layer	things.	Give	me	a	Snapchat	and	I’ll	make	you	a	funny	little
doodle,	but	give	me	a	pen	and	paper	or	a	paintbrush,	and	I	probably	can’t
do	much	for	you.
He	reached	out	to	a	talented	Snapchat	artist,	Michael	Platco,
who	 was	 getting	 a	 lot	 of	 engagement,	 and	 with	 the	 aim	 of
mutually	growing	 each	 one’s	 fan	 base,	 they	 created	 the	 first
Snapchat	collaboration:	a	boxing	match.	Each	invited	his	fans	to
send	his	opponent	“punches”	in	the	form	of	snaps	doodled	with
a	 colorful	Kapow!	 or	 two,	 with	 fists	 and	 boxing	 gloves.	 The
person	who	received	the	most	punches	would	be	KO’d.	Within
an	hour,	thousands	of	punches	were	thrown,	and	Shonduras	and
MPlatco	responded	to	each	round	with	selfies	doodled	to	make
themselves	look	pummeled	to	a	pulp.	They	finally	declared	the
fight	a	draw,	but	regardless,	Shaun	had	won	by	multiplying	his
audience	 by	 thousands,	making	 it	 possible	 for	 him	 to	 move
forward	with	the	next	stage	of	his	plan.
Goal	number	two	was	to	get	press.	The	major	hindrance	to
growing	a	brand	on	Snapchat	was	its	impermanence.	There	was
no	way	to	link,	no	way	to	share,	and	the	content	vaporized	after
twenty-four	hours.	The	only	way	Snapchatters	could	give	their
content	a	 longer	 lifespan	 and	 establish	 a	 permanent	 online
presence	 was	 to	 screen-shoot	 the	 images	 and	 push	 them	 onto
Twitter	and	Instagram.	The	other	way,	it	occurred	to	Shaun,	was
to	get	someone	to	write	about	him.	Snapchat	didn’t	even	have	a
website,	so	the	only	way	someone	could	learn	more	about	the
platform	was	through	Google.	Shonduras	intended	to	be	the	first
name	to	pop	up.

Once	 again,	 he	 got	 creative.	 His	 mother,	 understandably
proud	of	her	son,	had	contacted	a	media	outlet	and	suggested
they	feature	his	work.	Concerned	that	journalists	wouldn’t	pay
attention	to	a	self-promoter,	he	decided	to	use	his	mom’s	e-mail
address	to	pitch	stories	about	Snapchat.	Every	night,	he’d	ask	his
assistant	 in	 the	 Philippines	 to	 draft	 personalized	 e-mails	to
contacts	at	the	tech	trades—Mashable,	BuzzFeed,	and	Business
Insider,	for	example—with	an	attachment	of	his	work.	The	e-
mails	 were	 written	 in	 his	 mother’s	 voice:	 “I	 saw	 your	 recent
article	about	YouTube	and	I	thought	a	story	on	this	new	platform
called	Snapchat	might	be	a	good	fit	for	your	audience.	My	son
does	these	really	interesting	stories	there.	.	.	.”	In	the	morning
he’d	wake	up	to	three	or	four	e-mails	from	people	asking	his
mom	for	Shaun’s	number.
The	 media	 attention	 snowballed	 until	 he	 started	 getting
featured	 in	Time,	Forbes,	 and	Fast	Company.	 That	 kept	 him
relevant	and	top	of	mind,	so	when	brands	started	wondering	how
they	could	use	the	platform,	as	predicted,	his	was	the	first	name
they	thought	of.
While	all	this	was	happening,	Shaun	had	also	been	working
on	goal	number	three:	to	tell	a	story	for	a	brand.	“Every	brand
I’ve	spoken	to,	they	aren’t	just	a	product,	they	have	a	story,	and
they	 want	 to	 share	 it.”	 All	 along,	 he’d	 been	 hitting	 up	small
brands	 and	 local	 businesses	 to	 see	 if	 they	 would	 give	 him	 a
chance	 to	 create	 some	 work	 for	 them	 as	 a	 case	 study	 that	he
could	then	use	as	a	marketing	tool.	No	one	was	interested	until
he	wrote	to	Disney.	Unbelievably,	Disney,	the	biggest	brand	of
all,	said	yes.	Their	branding	slogan	that	year	was	“Show	your
Disney	 side,”	 so	 Shaun’s	 idea	 was	 to	 go	 to	 every	 part	 of
Disneyland	to	look	for	his	Disney	side,	snapping	and	doodling
as	he	went	along.	Was	he	more	of	a	Toon	guy,	a	Tomorrowland
guy,	 or	 an	 Adventureland	 guy?	 (In	 the	 end,	 he	 was	 an
Everything	guy,	snapping	a	photo	of	himself	sporting	doodled
Tarzan	dreads,	a	robot	arm,	Tinker	Bell	on	his	shoulder,	and	a
Captain	Hook	wig.)
From	there,	the	branding	work	took	off.	Besides	reprising	his
role	as	brand	ambassador	several	times	for	Disney,	Shaun	has
created	 Snapchat	 content	 for	 Red	 Bull,	 Xfinity	 Mobile,	 Taco
Bell,	and	many	other	companies.	He	even	got	to	help	promote

the	2015	release	of	Star	Wars:	The	Force	Awakens.	Even	at	the
height	of	his	success,	though,	he	was	looking	ahead	to	see	what
else	he	could	do.
“That’s	the	thing:	once	you’ve	crushed	something,	you’ve	got
to	keep	moving	on.	Who	knows	how	long	Snapchat’s	going	to
be	around?	Let’s	crush	it	again.”
While	 still	 going	 strong	 on	 Snapchat,	 Shaun	 started
developing	  his	  YouTube	  channel.	  Originally	  he	  was
documenting	the	scene	behind	the	scenes	of	his	crazy	Snapchat
adventures	and	travels,	but	as	he	started	creating	more	branded
YouTube	videos	and	his	life	became	increasingly	 packed	 with
meetings,	the	channel	increasingly	featured	all	the	characters	in
his	 life,	 from	the	 employees	 working	 in	 the	 “Spacestation”—
Shaun’s	studio	and	office—to	his	wife,	Jenny,	and	his	baby	girl,
Adley.	In	late	2016,	they	launched	a	second	YouTube	channel,
on	which	they	all	have	free	rein	to	bring	their	“weird	ideas”	to
life.	Shaun	envisions	it	as	a	sitcom	in	which	all	of	his	friends
and	family	play	a	distinct	role.	His	hope	is	that	his	audience	will
get	addicted	to	the	personalities	and	story	lines	just	as	they	once
did	with	shows	like	Seinfeld.
Though	his	YouTube	brand	deals	today	outnumber	those	he
does	 for	 Snapchat,	 his	 Snapchat	 following	 remains	 robust.	 In
addition,	he	 continues	 to	 accept	 speaking	 engagements,
including	 a	 TED	 Talk.	 He	 is	 also	 working	 as	 a	 consultant
helping	 brands	 to	 strategize,	work	 with	 influencers,	 and	 put
together	strong	social-media	campaigns.	In	2017,	he	announced
that	 he’ll	 be	 creating	 branded	content	 for	 Viacom,	 including
Nickelodeon	and	MTV.	And	he	recently	launched	a	successful
eSports	organization	with	some	of	the	number-one	teams	in	the
world.	There’s	no	sign	of	stopping.	Every	day,	this	long-haired
skater	 dude	 with	 the	 instincts	of	 a	 hardened	 businessman
commits	 to	 spreading	 positive	 messages	 and	 giving	 people	 a
reason	to	laugh	and	have	fun.
What’s	 the	 secret	 to	 his	 success?	 “Personal	 relationships.	 I
think	a	lot	of	people	establish	fake,	one-way	relationships—they
just	want	to	ask	for	something,	or	they	want	to	do	a	collab	and
get	a	shout-out.	They	don’t	develop	those	real	relationships	and
provide	value	and	just	give,	give,	give.	If	you	do	that,	eventually
you’ll	get	back,	and	that’s	where	the	success	comes.”

I	have	watched	this	man	execute	relentlessly	for	the	last	five
years	or	so.	What	I	love	most	about	him	is	how	his	happiness
comes	 through	 in	 everything	 that	 he	 does.	 He’s	 a	 classic
storyteller	who	isn’t	afraid	to	try	anything.	While	many	people
find	every	reason	in	the	world	to	say	no,	Shaun	says	yes.	That’s
his	secret	sauce.

Twitter
If	the	following	information	sounds	a	little	familiar,	as	though	you	might	have
read	it	before	in	Crush	It!,	that’s	because	you	did.	The	strategy	for	building	a
brand	on	Twitter	has	changed	little	in	nine	years,	but	most	people	still	haven’t
learned	how	to	do	it	correctly	and	effectively.
Twitter	is	the	water	cooler	of	society,	that	place	where	everyone	goes	to	get
the	latest	update	on	whatever	news	or	pop-culture	event	is	occurring.	The	only
difference	is	that,	while	office	workers	used	to	have	to	wait	until	the	day	after	an
event	 to	gather	 around	 and	 share	 their	 knowledge	 and	 opinions,	 now	 that
conversation	is	happening	in	real	time,	24/7.
At	the	time	of	this	writing,	Twitter,	in	this	one	man’s	opinion,	is	in	a	really
tricky	spot.	It	continues	to	remain	the	only	pure	social	network,	a	place	where
people	 interact	 with	 content,	 with	 each	 other,	 and	 with	 events	 in	 a	 way	 that
doesn’t	happen	anywhere	else.	Other	platforms	started	out	as	social	networks,	to
be	 sure,	 but	 eventually	 became	 content	 management	 systems.	There	 is
engagement,	but	on	a	far	smaller	scale	than	on	Twitter.	On	Twitter,	in	an	instant
you	can	dive	into	any	conversation	about	any	topic—cooking,	outer	space,	wine,
sneakers,	 politics,	 skateboards,	 seltzer.	 Done	 wisely,	 this	 engagement	 will
compel	people	to	seek	out	your	content	elsewhere.	Unfortunately,	this	ease	of
interaction	 led	 Twitter	 to	 develop	 more	 into	 a	 conversation	platform	 than	 a
consumption	 platform.	 People	 talk	 a	 lot	 on	 Twitter,	 and	 the	 sheer	 volume	 is
problematic.	You’re	going	to	consume	a	lot	more	of	what	I	say	if	you	hear	me
speak	at	a	keynote	than	if	we’re	having	a	conversation,	because	when	we	talk,

especially	in	a	group,	we’ll	probably	interrupt	each	other,	talk	over	each	other,
and	 get	 distracted	 by	 what	 else	 is	 going	 on	 in	 the	room.	 It’s	 difficult	 for
consumers	to	absorb	everything	you	want	them	to	when	you’re	talking	to	them
on	 Twitter.	 The	 constant	chatter	 and	 massive	 volume	 has	 been	 great	 for	 the
spread	of	ideas,	which	is	good	for	influencers	and	media	outlets,	but	the	chat	glut
has	also	made	it	harder	for	people	to	break	out	as	Twitter	personalities.
Twitter	101
Twitter	is	disproportionately	the	place	to	listen,	react,	and	hijack.	Problem	is,
most	people	aren’t	very	good	listeners,	and	it’s	often	an	especially	big	challenge
for	the	types	of	people	who	want	to	build	personal	brands	so	the	world	will	listen
to	them.	 But	 listening	 well	 is	 the	 key	 to	 engaging	 well	 on	 Twitter.	 It’s	 by
listening	 that	 you	 can	 find	 the	 conversation	 threads	that	 can	 lead	 you	 to	 the
people	passionate	about	the	subject	around	which	you’re	going	to	grow	your
influence.	If	you’re	a	lawyer	who	wants	to	be	the	next	influential	sportscaster,
it’s	 likely	 you’re	 going	 to	 put	 out	 amazing	 sports-related	 commentary	on
YouTube	and	create	a	sports	podcast.	Getting	anyone	to	give	you	even	a	passing
glance	 on	 those	 platforms,	 however,	 will	depend	 almost	 exclusively	 on	 the
quality	of	your	content,	and	even	then	a	huge	number	of	people	just	won’t	see
you.	But	on	Twitter,	a	rising	sportscaster	could	make	it	her	mission	to	find	all	the
people—every	single	one—talking	about	Kolten	Wong,	Adam	Wainwright,	the
Cardinals,	or	the	Cardinals’	archrivals,	the	Cubs,	Chicago,	or	Wrigley	Field,	and
reply	in	some	unthreatening,	interesting	way	that	creates	a	connection	between
her	 and	 each	 sports	 fan.	 The	 next	 day,	 she	 could	 do	 the	 very	 same	 thing	for
people	talking	about	the	Jets	and	all	Jets-related	topics.	If	she	does	it	well	and
frequently	 enough,	 eventually	 she	 can	virtually	 grab	 these	 people	 by	 the
shoulders	 and	 point	 them	 straight	 toward	 her	 website,	 YouTube	 channel,	 or
podcast.
The	thing	is,	it	will	take	a	shitload	of	discipline	and	patience.	Let	me	define
discipline:	it’s	backing	up	your	ambitions	with	 your	 actions.	 This	 rookie	 will
need	to	spend	four,	five,	even	six	hours	a	day	on	this	kind	of	engagement,	often
in	the	predawn	hours,	if	she	wants	to	become	the	next	Linda	Cohn.	If	she	just
wants	 a	 little	 name	 recognition	 from	 her	 town’s	 bar	regulars	 when	 they	 talk
about	their	local	team,	then	twenty	or	forty	minutes	per	day	will	be	perfectly
adequate.	Maybe.
Now,	keeping	people’s	attention	and	nabbing	a	subscription	or	a	loyal	fan	will

still	 rely	 entirely	 on	 the	 quality	 of	 what	those	 consumers	 find	 on	 our	 rookie
sportscaster’s	website,	but	the	point	is	that	Twitter	gives	you	a	chance	to	both
lure	and	lasso—or	jab	and	right	hook—people	into	your	orbit	in	a	way	that	no
other	platform	does.	It’s	a	slow,	slow,	slow	process	and	an	immense	amount	of
work,	but	if	you’re	willing	to	do	it	and	your	content	is	special,	you	should	see	a
payoff.
Twitter	201
Biz-dev.	Everyone	knows	that	Twitter	is	still	the	number-one	place	to	get	my
attention	because,	to	this	day,	I’m	still	consuming	what	people	are	saying	about
me	there	more	than	on	all	other	platforms	combined.	That’s	true	for	many	other
people	in	different	fields.	Because	it	was	built	to	be	a	conversation	platform,
Twitter	 is	 an	 interesting	 place	 to	 jump-start	 biz-dev	 opportunities	or
collaborations	 as	 you	 grow	 your	 brand—maybe	 even	 the	 best	 place.	 For
example,	 some	 influencers	 have	 hundreds	 of	 thousands,	even	 millions,	 of
followers	on	Instagram,	but	only	a	few	thousand	on	Twitter.	Where	do	you	think
they	get	the	most	requests	for	favors	or	collabs?	Instagram.	So	even	though	they
probably	 spend	 more	 time	 on	 Instagram,	 you’re	 more	 likely	 to	 have	 a	better
chance	of	getting	a	response	if	you	DM	them	on	Twitter,	where	there	is	less
competition	for	their	attention.
There	are	several	other	advantages	to	using	Twitter	as	your	pillar	content:
It’s	a	complete	and	trustworthy	directory.	The	platform	has	been	around
long	enough	to	have	perfected	its	verification	system,	which	gives	it	a
better	search	function.	You	can	still	spend	a	lot	of	time	guessing	whether
the	Instagram	account	you’re	targeting	is	real	or	not.
Its	retweet	feature	offers	a	remarkable	opportunity	to	create	instant
awareness.	Let’s	say	you	make	a	YouTube	mash-up	of	the	rapper
Logic’s	music	videos.	It’s	unlikely	he’s	going	to	see	it,	even	if	he’s
tagged.	Share	the	mash-up	on	Twitter,	however,	and	the	retweets	can
propel	your	video	to	dramatic	virality,	the	kind	that	even	the	biggest
influencers	notice.	This	kind	of	word	of	mouth	does	not	exist	on
Instagram	or	Snapchat	and	is	enormously	beneficial	to	content	creators.
Not	only	that,	you	can	try	to	spark	that	word	of	mouth	many,	many	more
times	on	Twitter	than	on	other	platforms.	I	post	three,	maybe	four	times
per	day	on	Instagram,	but	there	are	days	when	I	could	post	forty-seven

times	on	Twitter.	The	fact	that	it’s	as	welcoming	to	the	written	word	as
to	pictures	gives	content	creators	the	flexibility	and	leeway	to	increase
the	volume	of	their	storytelling.
On	Twitter,	you	are	always	just	one	comment	away	from	getting	noticed	and
making	a	name	for	yourself,	so	the	more	times	you	get	a	chance	to	talk,	the
better.	 Remember,	 though,	 that	 the	 best	 dinner	 guests	 are	 not	 just	 great
storytellers,	but	also	great	listeners.	So	bring	all	your	smarts,	your	wit,	and	your
cleverness	 to	 the	 party,	 keep	 the	 conversation	 going	 by	 engaging	everyone
around	 you,	 and	 watch	 your	 influence	 grow	 and	 your	 opportunities	 multiply.
There’s	no	other	platform	that	gives	you	this	opening	to	introduce	yourself	to	so
many	people	so	often.	Don’t	ignore	it.
Imagine	This
Let’s	say	you’re	a	twenty-two-year-old	college	student	named	Anna,	and	your
dream	is	to	be	a	sports	commentator.	I	know	there	are	a	lot	of	you	out	there
because	you	e-mail	me	pretty	much	every	month	asking	me	to	help	you	get	an
internship	at	ESPN	or	Bleacher	Report	or	Barstool	Sports.	You	know	what	that
means?	That	means	that	even	the	kids	who	have	spent	most	of	their	lives	steeped
in	social	media	and	can	hardly	remember	a	time	before	Twitter	are	still	looking
at	the	world	through	a	narrow	lens	and	completely	missing	the	big	career	and
personal	brand–building	opportunities	right	in	front	of	them.
The	 wonderful	 thing	 about	 sports	 is	 that	 they’re	 a	 great	 equalizer.	 Any
basketball	fan	can	walk	up	to	a	group	of	twenty	people	they	don’t	know	debating
LeBron	versus	Jordan	and	within	minutes	be	part	of	the	mix.	For	many	people,
they’re	 the	 easiest	icebreaker.	 Sports	 also	 help	 people	 ease	 into	 new
relationships,	offering	a	way	to	connect	with	strangers	without	having	to	rely	on
other	social	identifiers,	like	your	job,	neighborhood,	or	school.	Twitter	was	built
for	those	kinds	of	conversations.	In	fact,	there’s	no	better	place	than	Twitter	for
sports	 personalities	 and	 enthusiasts,	 because	 there	 is	 literally	 no	 limit	to	 the
number	and	kind	of	sports	conversations	in	which	you	could	engage.
Now	 think	 about	 this:	 who	 do	 you	 think	 has	 a	 better	 chance	 of	 getting	 an
internship	with	ESPN:	(a)	the	unknown	kid	who	sends	her	résumé	in	along	with
four	 thousand	 other	 people	 applying	 for	 the	 same	 job	 and	 has	 nothing	 but	 a
prayer	 that	 the	 director	of	 the	 internship	 program	 will	 bother	 to	 look	 at	 her
portfolio,	or	(b)	the	kid	who	becomes	a	regular,	active	presence	in	the	Twitter

feeds	of	all	the	ESPN	personalities	and	staff	who	actually	rely	on	intern	help?
The	thing	that	differentiates	sportscasters	from	one	another	is	their	greater	or
lesser	ability	to	synthesize	data,	of	course,	but	also	the	particular	ways	they	add
their	two	or	three	or	nine	cents	to	the	event	at	hand,	whether	it’s	the	McGregor
versus	Mayweather	fight,	or	the	Cavaliers	versus	the	Warriors,	or	the	Wimbledon
tennis	finals.	Twitter	is	unmatched	in	its	ability	to	help	you	amplify	your	voice
and	your	brand.	If	you’re	looking	for	a	job	or	hoping	to	make	your	mark	in	an
industry,	consider	your	activity	there	as	the	longest	interview	of	your	life.	And
that’s	 a	 good	 thing.	 There	 are	 few	 feelings	 more	 frustrating	than	 leaving	 an
interview	wishing	you	could	have	said	one	more	thing	to	show	off	what	you
know	or	to	emphasize	your	value	to	an	organization.	You	never	have	to	feel	that
way	on	Twitter;	the	forum	gives	you	endless	opportunities	to	prove	why	you’re
special	and	deserve	to	be	respected.
So	use	Twitter	to	show	the	world—and	in	particular,	all	the	important	people
at	various	sports	outlets	who	might	need	interns—your	unique	perspective	and
personality.
Start	by	looking	at	the	trending	topics	(in	the	mobile	app,	you’ll	see	them
listed	when	you	click	on	the	Search	symbol).	There	is	bound	to	be	something
sports	related	there.	Click	on	it,	and	then	start	expressing	your	thoughts.	You	can
do	this	in	two	ways.	You	could	just	start	writing.	With	a	280-character	limit,	it
could	take	you	eleven	tweets	to	say	everything	you	want	to,	but	that’s	OK.	Or
you	could	try	recording	a	video	of	yourself	talking	about	the	topic	(the	current
video	 time	 limit	 on	Twitter	 is	 140	 seconds),	 then	 posting	 that.	 Include	 the
relevant	hashtag	so	that	everyone	else	searching	for	information	on	that	topic
will	 see	 your	 tweets.	 Once	 you’ve	 exhausted	 yourself	 with	 the	 trends,	 start
searching	 other	 sports	 topics	 and	 inserting	yourself	 into	 the	 conversations
happening	around	them	by	replying	to	people’s	tweets.	You	show	you’re	well
rounded	 by	 sharing	your	 thoughts	 all	 day,	 every	 day,	 via	 text	 or	 video,	 on
everything	from	the	NHL	to	MMA,	the	PGA,	and	World	Taekwondo	(which	was
known	as	the	WTF	until	June	2017,	when	it	rebranded	and	dropped	the	word
Federation	from	its	name).	You	reply	to	famous	people,	you	create	content	in
response	to	well-known	sportswriters,	personalities,	coaches,	and	athletes.	You
give	yourself	every	possible	opportunity	to	be	discovered	as	people	hit	those
hashtags	and	watch	those	conversations.
Done	right,	this	should	take	you	four	to	six	hours.
That’s	day	one.
On	day	two,	you	do	it	again—for	four	to	six	hours,	or	as	many	as	you	can

spare	when	you’re	not	at	work	or	school.	Remember,	eleven	minutes	is	eleven
more	than	zero,	but	also	remember,	twelve	minutes	gives	you	more	at	bats	to	win
than	eleven.
Day	three	is	a	Saturday.	Awesome!	It’s	your	day	off!	That	means	you	can
spend	ten	to	seventeen	hours	seeking	out	sports-related	topics	and	engaging	with
others	interested	in	them,	too.
Day	four,	Sunday,	the	day	of	rest.	You	“sleep	in”—an	extra	hour—so	you	only
get	ten	to	sixteen	hours	to	work,	but	you	make	them	count.
Day	five.	Monday.	Go	to	work,	go	to	school.	Tweet	during	any	downtime,
such	as	lunch	or	walking	between	classes.	Meet	your	parents	for	dinner	(put	the
phone	away).	Go	home.	Study	for	your	upcoming	test	if	you	must,*	and	tweet
until	two	a.m.
Do	this	repeatedly,	consistently,	constantly,	until	your	thumbs	are	callused	and
your	eyes	are	bleeding,	or	at	least	until	you	feel	they	should	be.
One	of	those	tweets,	maybe	within	those	five	days	but	probably	more	like	a
year	down	the	line,	will	be	the	piece	of	content	that	catches	the	eye	of	someone
at	a	sports	station	in	Kansas	City	or	Montreal	or	Chicago,	who	will	reach	out	to
you	to	find	out	where	you’re	working	and	whether	you’d	be	interested	in	joining
their	team.	Or	maybe	a	news	station	will	contact	you	and	ask	you	to	comment
for	an	article	(news	stations	monitor	Twitter	closely	for	material).	One	piece	of
content	in	a	Twitter	environment	can	be	worth	a	hundred	on	any	other	platform.
It’s	that	disproportionately	impactful.
I	 want	 to	 make	 something	 very	 clear.	 This	 book,	 like	 99	 percent	 of	 my
content,	is	for	people	who	aren’t	100	percent	happy,	for	those	who	complain	or
wish	or	hope	or	wonder	“What	if?”	I	talk	about	working	twelve-,	fourteen-,	or
seventeen-hour	days	because	that’s	what	it	took	most	of	today’s	success	stories
and	 entrepreneurial	 role	 models	 to	 get	 to	 where	 they	 are.	 I	 don’t	actually
recommend	unhealthy	lifestyles,	like	getting	too	little	sleep	or	isolating	yourself
from	your	family,	but	to	all	the	critics	who	say	entrepreneurs	like	you	and	me
don’t	have	work-life	balance	or	are	shortchanging	our	health,	I	ask	you	this:	has
it	ever	occurred	to	you	that	the	people	you’re	insisting	should	get	eight	hours	of
sleep	are	so	unhappy	with	the	sixteen	hours	they’re	awake	that	they’re	willing	to
invest	this	many	hours	to	change	their	lives	for	the	better?	Which	would	you
rather	have,	a	long	night’s	sleep	and	sixteen	hours	of	misery	every	day	or	a	little
less	sleep	but	twenty	hours	of	wide-awake	joy?	I’ll	pick	joy	every	time,	and	so
will	most	people	who	are	crushing	it.

How	I’m	Crushing	It
Jared	Polin,	FroKnowsPhoto
YouTube:	froknowsphoto
Jared	 Polin’s	 father	 had	 a	 great	 way	 of	 explaining	 why	 he
always	wanted	to	be	his	own	boss:	“I’m	not	going	to	be	told
when	I	can	take	a	leak.”	A	children’s	clothing	salesman,	he	was
known	for	his	honesty.	When	Jared	decided	to	go	into	business
for	himself,	he	vowed	that	honesty	would	be	one	of	his	calling
cards,	too.	Along	with	his	hair	pick.
Jared	 uses	 a	 hair	 pick	 as	 a	 business	 card	 because	 he	 has	 a
seriously	 big	 afro,	 and	 because	 he	 is	 the	 founder	 of
FroKnowsPhoto,	a	 YouTube	 channel	 dedicated	 to	 “fun	 and
informative	videos”	about	everything	you’d	want	to	know	about
photography,	 from	 proper	lighting	 techniques	 to	 choosing	 the
best	gear.	He	spent	his	youth	working	in	a	camera	store,	started
shooting	professionally	at	the	age	of	fifteen,	and	spent	ten	years
touring	with	bands.	This	is	not	someone	who	ever	had	to	think
hard	to	identify	his	passion.
For	years	he	had	had	a	beautiful	website	that	featured	his	best
work,	 but	 he	 hadn’t	 seen	 much	 business	 come	 of	 it.	 He	 was
twenty-nine	 years	 old.	 His	 mother	 had	 passed	 away
unexpectedly	of	cancer,	and	he’d	stayed	home	to	help	his	father
take	 care	of	 his	 centenarian	 grandmother.	 He	 was	 shooting
weddings,	the	usual	gigs	photographers	do	to	make	their	living,
and	earning	$20K,	maybe	$30K	a	year.	At	the	time,	most	people
were	saying	that	blogs	were	the	way	to	build	an	audience,	but	he
didn’t	consider	 himself	 a	 writer.	 Yet	 he’d	 watch	 other
photographers’	  YouTube	  channels	  and	  be	  consistently
unimpressed	with	the	information	they	were	putting	out.	Rather
than	criticize	and	tell	them	what	they	were	doing	wrong	in	their
comments	sections,	he	simply	decided	to	do	it	better.
He’d	attended	an	event,	bartering	his	photography	skills	for	a
ticket,	where	he	had	heard	this	loud	wine	salesman	talk	about
how	he	had	used	video	to	grow	his	family’s	liquor	store.

This	guy	was	very	real	and	not	trying	to	sell	anything,	even	though	he’d
just	written	a	book.	And	he	said,	“There’s	no	secret	to	being	successful
on	the	Internet.	You	need	to	be	good	at	what	you	do;	you	need	to	be
passionate	about	it	and	go	crush	it.”	That	resonated	with	me.	It	was	like	a
weight	lifted	off	my	shoulders	because	someone	else	was	saying	what	I
was	thinking.	I	had	tried	some	things	in	the	past,	to	make	a	couple	videos
and	put	them	up,	but	for	whatever	reason,	my	head	wasn’t	in	it.	I	just
wasn’t	 ready,	 I	 guess,	 at	 the	 time.	 And	 reading	 the	 book,	 something
clicked,	and	I	thought,	Now	I’m	ready	to	do	this.	He	did	this	in	the	wine
world;	there’s	no	reason	why	I	can’t	go	out	there	and	exploit	it	in	the
photo	world.
The	original	purpose	of	the	videos	Jared	made	was	to	help
him	 book	 more	 photo	 gigs.	 Instead,	 people	 started	 coming	 to
him	for	advice	about	how	to	buy	camera	equipment.	Previously
he’d	 always	 considered	 anyone	 else	 taking	 pictures	 as	 the
competition.	The	 last	 thing	 he’d	 consider	 doing	 was	 helping
them	so	they	could	compete	for	the	jobs	he	wanted.	Now	he	did
a	 one-eighty	and	 decided	 he	 was	 going	 to	 give	 all	 his
information	 away	 for	 free.	 “Because	 you	 know	 what?	 People
don’t	have	what	I	have.”
There	was	another	motivation	as	well.	His	mother’s	death	lay
heavily	on	him.	For	years	she	had	asked	her	son	to	teach	her
how	to	better	use	a	camera,	but	time	had	gotten	away	from	them
until	they	didn’t	have	any	left.	“It’s	one	of	the	biggest	regrets	in
my	life.	She	wanted	to	learn	photography.	There’s	no	reason	I
shouldn’t	have	taken	the	time	to	do	this.	Other	people	need	to
benefit	from	the	knowledge	that	I	have	so	they	can	be	successful
and	continue	on.”
He	maxed	out	a	$15,000	credit	card	with	an	18-month	period
of	 0	 percent	 financing,	 which	 he	 suspects	 was	 meant	 for	 his
father	but	had	his	name	on	it.	He	bought	camera	equipment	and
merch,	then	started	putting	out	content.
I	found	the	thing	that	I	could	do,	and	I	beat	the	shit	out	of	it.	I	locked
myself	away	for	two	years.	Every	day,	day	in	and	day	out.	I	shot	a	video
every	single	day.	Wake	up	in	the	morning,	come	up	with	an	idea,	shoot	a
video,	 edit	 it,	 have	 lunch,	come	 back,	 put	 it	 out	 into	 the	 world,	 have
dinner,	 then	 stay	 up	 until	 one	 or	 two	 in	 the	 morning	 replying	 to
comments.	I	didn’t	use	teleprompters	or	anything.	If	I	made	a	mistake,	I
would	make	fun	of	myself	and	keep	going,	partly	because	I	didn’t	know
how	to	edit	video.	All	I	knew	how	to	do	was	put	a	beginning	and	an	end
on	it.	Sometimes	good	enough	is	good	enough.

Within	six	months,	he	saw	a	rise	in	viewership:	one	hundred
views,	 then	 two	 hundred.	 All	 along,	 he	 was	 commenting,
answering	questions,	 and	 interacting	 with	 viewers.	 He	 made
himself	available	to	anyone	who	wanted	to	talk.
Crush	It!	talks	about	building	your	business	off	of	search.twitter.com.	I
also	made	it	a	point	to	answer	every	single	e-mail	that	came	in.	I	put	up
my	Skype	number	so	that	anybody	could	call	at	any	hour.	If	I	was	sitting
there,	I	would	take	the	call.	Then	I	would	get	the	caller’s	permission	to
record	 the	 call,	 because	 there’s	 nothing	 like	 free	 content.	 They	 were
asking	me	questions,	and	if	they’re	asking	it,	then	other	people	probably
have	the	same	one.
He	 made	 some	 connections	 to	 appear	 on	 other	 people’s
YouTube	channels.	As	the	number	of	viewers	started	to	climb,
so	 did	 the	number	 of	 subscribers.	 In	 short	 order,	 Nikon	 and
Canon	 and	 other	 photography	 brands	 started	 asking	 him	 to
review	gear.	Sometimes	they	even	offered	to	pay	him	to	do	it.
“I’m	very	up	front.	Someone	might	pay	me,	but	they	can’t	tell
me	what	to	say.	If	there’s	going	to	be	something	bad	about	a
product,	I’m	telling	you	what’s	bad,	whether	they’re	paying	me
or	not.	It’s	all	about	building	credibility.”
The	free	model	worked	so	well	that	in	the	end	he	didn’t	need
to	take	other	people’s	photography	jobs.	Now	he	barters	trades
with	 bands	 and	 musicians	 he	 wants	 to	 cover.	 They	 give	 him
access,	 and	 he	 gets	 more	 content	 to	 share	 with	 the	 world.	 In
seven	years,	he’s	put	out	2,400	videos,	all	dedicated	to	helping
other	 people	 become	 better	 photographers,	 and	 received	 one
hundred	million	views	on	YouTube.	At	the	end	of	the	first	two
years,	he’d	generated	about	$80,000	in	revenue.	Today	he	says
he	can	generate	seven	figures.
You	 are	 not	 going	 to	 be	 successful	 unless	 you	 put	 the	 work	 in.	 If
anybody	 tells	 you	 otherwise,	 they’re	 full	 of	 shit.	 It’s	all	 of	 the
perseverance	and	all	of	the	hard	work	you	put	in	in	the	decades	leading
up	 to	 it	 that	 make	 you	 ready.	 Are	 you	 passionate	about	 what	 you’re
doing?	Are	you	good	at	what	you’re	doing?	Then	fucking	do	it.	It’s	one
thing	to	read	the	book;	it’s	another	thing	to	take	action.
I’ve	watched	Jared	carefully	for	years,	and	what	stands	out	to
me	is	his	inability	to	complain.	Like	me,	he	put	out	hundreds	of
hours	of	content	while	receiving	little	traction	up	front.	But	that
didn’t	stop	him.	That’s	the	difference	between	him	and	almost

everyone	else,	including	most	of	the	people	who	will	read	this
book—he	didn’t	give	up	too	early.	Persistence	is	everything.

YouTube
YouTube	makes	me	so	happy.	It’s	here	that	I	believe	I	can	possibly	help	change
a	life	faster	than	anywhere	else.	Since	2009,	millions	of	people	have	quit	their
jobs	and	started	making	a	living	on	this	platform.	It’s	the	whole	reason	Crush	It!
and	this	book	and	the	books	in	between	and	everything	else	in	my	professional
world	came	to	be.
Ironically,	YouTube	is	also	where	I	made	one	of	the	biggest	mistakes	in	my
career.	 I	 was	 a	 breakout	 star	 on	 YouTube	 in	 2006,	but	 by	 the	 time	 I	 started
writing	Crush	 It!,	 I	 had	 decided	 that	 Viddler,	 its	 competitor,	 had	 a	 tagging
system	and	management	team	that	made	it	a	superior	platform	for	me	and	my
content,	which	was	unusually	long	by	2007	standards.	In	addition,	I’ll	admit	I
was	 swayed	 by	 a	 short-term	 economic	decision:	 the	 company	 gave	 me
substantial	equity	in	the	business.*	I	was	certain	that	my	advocacy	and	ability	to
put	the	platform	in	context	for	everyone	would	ensure	its	rise	to	prominence,	but
I	was	wrong.	But	you	know	what?	It	didn’t	matter,	because	in	the	end,	whether	I
was	talking	Viddler,	YouTube,	or	Google	Video,	my	advice	on	how	to	crush	it	in
video	would	have	been	100	percent	the	same.
I	 suspect	 YouTube	 has	 created	 more	 wealth	 and	 more	 opportunities	 in	 the
Crush	It!	model	than	any	other	platform	to	date.	It’s	certainly	the	most	important
platform	 for	 building	 a	 personal	 brand,	 though	 Instagram	is	 closing	 the	 gap
quickly.	It	could	take	the	place	of	television.	Increasing	numbers	of	people	are
streaming	YouTube	onto	their	TV	screens,	and	during	prime-time	hours	on	an
average	 day	 in	 the	 United	 States,	 more	 eighteen-to-forty-nine-year-olds	visit
YouTube	 than	 any	 TV	 network,	 even	 on	 mobile	 alone.

	 That’s	 tough	 news.	 I

know	that	not	everybody	who’s	reading	this	book	is	cut	out	for	video,	which	is
why	 I’m	 so	 thankful	 that	other	 alternatives	 exist	 to	 beautifully	 showcase	 the
written	word,	still	images,	and	audio.	However,	let’s	be	real.	With	perhaps	the
notable	 exception	 of	 J.	 K.	 Rowling,	 author	 of	 the	 Harry	 Potter	 series,	 and	 a
handful	of	other	writers,	in	general	over	the	last	thirty	years,	video	stars	have
financially	outperformed	stars	in	every	other	medium.
YouTube	101
Please,	even	if	you	don’t	think	you’re	video	material,	give	the	platform	a	try.	So
many	 people	 don’t	 think	 of	 themselves	 as	cameraworthy,	 but	 vlogging	 and
documenting	 doesn’t	 demand	 that	 you	 be	 glamorous	 or	 beautiful	 or	 really
superficially	special	at	all.	Have	you	looked	at	what’s	out	there?	Aside	from	the
beauty	 bloggers,	 the	 bodybuilders,	 and	 the	 rising	 pop	 idols—in	other	 words,
aside	from	everyone	in	an	industry	where	your	looks	really	matter—everyone	on
YouTube	 looks	 pretty	 damned	 ordinary.	 There	 are	 vloggers	 with	 disfiguring
tumors,	vloggers	with	disabilities,	vloggers	of	all	ages	and	shapes.	Vlogging	is	a
terrific	way	to	document	instead	of	create,	which	means	that	literally	anyone	can
do	it.	You	don’t	need	to	be	accomplished	(at	least	not	in	the	way	99	percent	of
you	reading	this	define	accomplishment)	to	break	out	on	this	platform	because,
remember,	when	you’re	documenting	and	not	creating,	you’re	allowed	to	learn
as	you	go.	You	don’t	have	to	be	an	expert	(yet).	You	don’t	have	to	be	successful
(yet).	The	only	thing	you	really	do	have	to	do	is	make	the	road	to	getting	there
interesting.
Now,	 interesting	 is	 subjective.	 You	 know	 what	 I	 find	 super	 interesting	 to
watch?	Videos	about	hitting	up	garage	sales.	And	I’m	not	the	only	one.	As	I
write,	a	quick	search	on	YouTube	shows	videos	devoted	to	the	topic	of	garage
saling	 receiving	 as	many	 as	 50,000,	 99,000,	 and	 137,000	 views.	 Don’t	 ever
decide	for	yourself	that	videos	about	you	or	the	things	you	like	to	do	won’t	be
compelling	to	anyone	else.	Let	the	market	decide.	Trust	me,	it’ll	be	honest	with
you.
Vlogging	is	a	great	equalizer,	and	YouTube	is	the	vlogging	mother	ship.	It’s
the	platform	where	the	person	no	one	thought	would	amount	to	anything	can
make	it.	It’s	a	tool	for	finding	your	best	angle,	and	I	don’t	mean	camera	angle.	If
you	have	a	lot	of	interests,	if	you	aren’t	sure	where	your	greatest	skills	lie,	if	you
wonder	whether	you	have	the	kind	of	charisma	and	appeal	that	draws	audiences
to	YouTube	personalities,	or	if	you	simply	can’t	decide	whether	you’d	rather	be

the	number-one	American	authority	on	pajamas	or	the	go-to	guru	for	kombucha,
pick	up	your	phone	and	start	documenting	your	day.	Put	the	results	up	daily	as	a
YouTube	 vlog.	 See	 which	 posts	 get	 the	 most	 attention	 and	 double	 down	 on
whatever	it	is	that’s	making	those	posts	stick.	But	you	have	to	put	something	out
to	know	if	you’ve	got	the	goods.	I	didn’t	mull	over	whether	I	should	start	Wine
Library	or	debate	whether	I	was	good	enough	to	deserve	a	YouTube	audience.
The	second	I	thought	filming	a	wine	review	show	was	a	good	idea,	I	had	an
employee	go	to	Best	Buy	to	buy	the	camera,	filmed	the	first	episode,	and	posted
it.	That	first	episode	looks	and	sounds	totally	different	from	the	ones	I	created
even	four	months	later	because	I	figured	out	that	I	could	be	me.	I’d	held	back,
not	because	I	was	worried	about	the	opinion	of	the	world	at	large,	but	because	I
was	afraid	if	I	really	let	loose,	I’d	jeopardize	all	the	hard-won	relationships	the
wine	store	had	with	longtime	customers	who	bought	$10,000	of	wine	from	me
every	month.
If	you	look	at	the	first	episode,	I’m	almost	unrecognizable.	Not	because	I’m
over	a	decade	younger	and	fifteen	pounds	heavier,	but	because	my	personality	is
so	subdued.	I	say	very	wine-experty	things	like,	“When	I	smell	this,	it	reminds
me	of	a	classic	Clinet	or	a	VCC”	and	“I’m	not	going	to	push	the	Pétrus	.	.	.”
Then	in	episode	11,	you	can	see	on	the	wall	behind	me	a	framed	black-and-white
photo	of	Muhammad	Ali	and	Joe	Frazier	battling	it	out	in	the	1971	Fight	of	the
Century.	That	may	have	been	the	first	piece	of	the	real	me,	the	boxing-loving
me,	that	made	its	way	into	the	show.
In	episode	40,	I	start	talking	about	joy	and	passion	and	cut	to	a	clip	from	the
televised	2006	NFL	draft,	where	I	was	caught	on	camera	screaming	my	head	off
with	 excitement	 with	 my	 friends	 and	 my	 brother,	 A.	 J.,	 in	 response	 to	 the
announcement	that	the	Jets	had	selected	D’Brickashaw	Ferguson,	an	offensive
tackle	 from	 the	 University	 of	 Virginia,	 over	 quarterback	 Matt	 Leinart.	I	 was
starting	to	reveal	other	sides	of	me,	because,	as	I	said	at	the	end	of	the	episode,
“You’ve	got	to	be	passionate	about	other	things	besides	wine.”	It’s	right	around
this	time	that	I	started	to	realize	that	the	world	was	changing	so	much	that	this
channel	could	potentially	get	much	bigger	than	I’d	ever	anticipated,	and	it	might
be	 worth	 risking	 a	 few	 short-term	 wine	losses	 in	 exchange	 for	 the	 long-term
value	of	allowing	myself	to	be	me.
By	episode	57,	I	give	a	virtual	finger	to	the	establishment.	Episode	58	gets
even	more	real	with	the	title,	“I’m	Not	Pissed,”	and	reveals	that	I	turned	down
two	network	opportunities,	one	in	a	travel	genre,	one	in	a	food-and-wine	genre,
because	I	didn’t	believe	that	TV	was	the	future.	Now	remember,	this	is	supposed
to	be	a	wine	show!	My	energy	is	rising,	my	voice	is	going	faster,	and	I’m	being
more	direct.	And	then	my	confidence	really	kicks	in	with	comments	like,	“We’re

the	best	marketers	in	the	wine	business.	We	don’t	need	a	blog	to	sell	wine.”	I
start	dropping	colorful	phrases	like	“bull	crap”	and	“Taste	the	goddamn	wine!”
like	bright	pomegranate	seeds	into	my	monologues.	By	episode	61,	when	I	start
asking	for	people	to	keep	e-mailing	me	because	my	mail	was	confirming	that	I
was	hitting	a	nerve	and	getting	people	excited	and	interested,	my	opening	is	less
Masterpiece	Theatre,	more	WWE.
As	you	can	see,	the	delivery,	quality,	and	content	of	Wine	Library	TV	changed
over	time.	I	gave	the	show	time	to	evolve.	I	gave	myself	time	to	get	comfortable
and	relax	into	the	format.	I	gave	myself	time	to	get	to	know	my	audience	and
listen	to	what	it	was	saying.	It	has	been	pointed	out	to	me	that	my	first	video	was
ten	times	better	than	some	people’s	hundredth	in	terms	of	quality	and	content.
Maybe,	but	again,	quality	is	subjective;	some	people	are	successful	despite	being
complete	idiots	because	the	public	loves	to	watch	them	be	idiots.	For	sure	I’m
coherent	and	you	can	tell	I	know	my	shit.	That	was	definitely	a	good	start,	but
remember,	there	is	no	way	I	could	have	known	that	I’d	be	good	on	video	at	the
time.	If	I	had	sat	on	my	idea	of	starting	a	wine	show	and	worried	and	second-
guessed	myself,	 I	could	 have	 probably	found	 a	hundred	 reasons	 not	to	 do	 it.
Thank	God	I	didn’t	stop	to	do	any	of	that	but	went	with	my	gut.	YouTube	isn’t
going	to	make	you	charismatic	and	interesting,	but	it	will	expose	you	if	you	are.
It	can’t	do	that,	however,	if	you	don’t	put	yourself	out	there.	Give	yourself	a	year
to	adjust	and	try	different	approaches	and	see	what	kind	of	response	you	get.
Listen	to	your	audience.	Ultimately,	it	all	boils	down	to	this:	don’t	let	perfection
be	your	enemy.	Do	not	be	another	dreamer	who	puts	up	ten	episodes,	gets	trolled
or	ignored,	gets	discouraged,	and	takes	the	channel	down.	For	God’s	sake,	give
yourself	a	fair	chance	to	succeed.
Every	 single	 thing	 that	 has	 ever	 happened	 on	 television	 can	 happen	 on
YouTube.	You	can	break	out	as	a	pop	star.	You	can	be	a	filmmaker.	You	can
become	Billy	Mays,	the	infomercial	pitchman.	You	want	to	become	a	morning
TV	star?	Start	a	morning	TV	show	on	YouTube.	You	want	to	be	the	next	Dr.
Drew?	Start	a	Q&A	show.	You	want	to	be	the	next	Rachael	Ray,	Oprah,	Tavis
Smiley,	or	 Chris	 Hardwick?	 Then	 start	 cooking,	 mentoring,	 interviewing,	 or
talking	pop	culture	on	YouTube.	Tomorrow.
Yes,	it	will	be	harder	today	than	it	would	have	been	had	you	started	doing	this
in	2011,	when	there	were	a	lot	of	people	watching	but	not	as	many	creating,	but
if	you	are	really	talented,	smart,	funny,	or	creative,	you	will	win.	It	might	take
you	a	few	more	months	or	even	years	than	it	would	have	in	2011,	but	it	will
happen.
Taking	 the	 “document,	 don’t	 create”	 approach	 means	 you	 are	 conceivably

going	to	pour	a	shitload	of	boring	content	into	the	miasma	of	boring	content
already	living	on	YouTube.
That’s	OK.
You	know	why?
Because	if	in	the	end	the	rest	of	the	world	agrees	that	your	content	is	boring,
you’ll	know	that	you’re	not	cut	out	for	this,	and	you	can	move	on	to	something
else.
Or	it	might	be	because	you’ll	get	an	e-mail	from	one	of	the	six	people	who
watched	episode	94	of	your	200	yarn	episodes,	who	happens	to	be	the	CEO	of
your	favorite	yarn	company,	telling	you	he’d	love	to	work	together	one	day	if
you’re	interested.	You	decide	you’re	never	going	to	become	a	PBS	star,	call	him
up,	and	work	out	a	deal	where	you	create	educational	videos	for	the	company
website.	They’re	a	big	company,	so	they	get	four	hundred	thousand	views	per
episode,	 allowing	 you	 to	 build	 your	brand	 through	 them.	 They’re	 also	 big
enough	to	pay	you	very	well	to	do	something	you	love.
It	might	be	because	you	discover	that,	even	though	the	general	public	didn’t
get	caught	up	in	your	craft-beer	vlog,	you	had	more	fun	doing	that	than	you’ve
ever	 had	 in	 your	 career	 as	 a	 software	 developer.	 So	 you	 approach	 Yuengling
about	making	educational	training	videos	for	their	staff,	and	they	bring	you	on
board	for	a	high	five-figure	salary.	The	pay	isn’t	that	different	from	what	you
earned	before,	but	you	go	to	bed	happy	every	Sunday,	excited	to	get	back	to
work	the	next	day.
Did	you	become	a	millionaire?	No.	But	only	a	tiny	percent	of	the	people	who
try	 this	 will.	 That’s	 irrelevant.	 The	 point	 is	to	 dream	 big	 and	 then	 make	 the
practical	 adjustments	 necessary	 once	 you	 see	 where	 your	 potential	 lies.
However,	you	will	never,	ever	know	the	extent	of	that	potential	until	you	try.	I
guarantee	it’s	greater	than	you	think	it	is.
For	a	couple	of	years	now,	the	tech-savvy	early	adopters	have	been	watching
YouTube	on	their	television	sets.	Very	soon,	everyone	is	going	to	be	doing	it,	and
the	next	generation	will	not	see	any	difference	between	the	two.	YouTube	will	be
television;	television	will	be	YouTube.	YouTube	is	a	monster.	Yet	Facebook	is
making	plans	to	add	more	features	that	will	make	it	look	a	lot	like	YouTube.
With	 YouTube	 in	 possession	 of	 a	 decade	 of	 equity	 as	 the	 established	 video
platform,	Facebook	is	going	to	have	to	work	its	ass	off	to	compete.	As	you’re
about	to	see,	it’s	gonna	be	a	hell	of	a	fight.

Imagine	This
Let’s	say	your	name	is	Sam.	You’re	a	fifty-two-year-old	insurance	salesperson	in
Alabama.	Your	twins	just	headed	off	to	college,	leaving	you	alone	with	your
partner	and	the	two	dogs	who	have	been	a	part	of	the	family	since	the	children
were	tiny.	As	excited	as	you	are	to	start	this	new	chapter	in	your	life,	you	know
it’s	going	to	be	hard	adjusting	to	a	home	where	there	are	no	longer	any	kids
around	to	make	messes,	cause	drama,	and	add	sparks	and	unpredictability	to	an
otherwise	 staid	 and	 calm	 life.	 You’ve	been	 working	 for	 the	 same	 insurance
company	for	twenty-two	years.	You	think	retirement	is	probably	only	about	ten
to	fifteen	years	away.	You’ve	saved	steadily	and	invested	wisely,	you	have	little
debt,	and	the	house	is	mostly	paid	off.	Life	is	fine.
Just	fine.
Then	your	best	friend	sends	you	a	video	called	“6	Mins	for	the	Next	60	Years
of	Your	Life.”	(Google	it.)
You	realize	that	you	have	potentially	thirty	to	forty	more	years	ahead	of	you,
and	you	want	them	to	be	more	than	just	fine.	You	want	them	to	be	great.	And
with	the	kids	finding	their	independence,	you	now	have	about	twice	the	number
of	hours	you	once	did	to	make	them	that	way.
You	start	thinking	about	all	the	fun	hobbies	and	interests	you	let	drop	as	life
became	busier	and	your	responsibilities	increased.	You	always	loved	to	dance.
Your	mom	forced	you	into	ballroom	dance	classes	when	you	were	a	child,	and	to
your	 surprise	 you	not	 only	 really	 enjoyed	 the	 rhythms	 and	 moves	 of	 salsa,
merengue,	and	swing,	but	you	were	damn	good	at	them.	The	skill	served	you
well	on	the	dating	scene—it’s	how	you	met	your	spouse.	But	you	both	let	the
hobby	drop	as	you	settled	into	married	life.	It’s	also	been	six	years	since	you	set
foot	in	a	gym;	by	now	your	knees	would	probably	buckle	after	two	rock	steps.
But	maybe	they	wouldn’t?	And	if	they	did,	maybe	instead	of	pathetic,	that
could	be	.	.	.	funny?	Maybe	it	would	be	something	you	and	your	partner	could
laugh	about	together?
You	make	a	pitch	to	your	partner:	let’s	get	in	shape	and	start	dancing	again.
And	to	keep	us	accountable,	let’s	film	the	whole	process.	Your	partner	sees	how
excited	you	are	about	this,	gingerly	pinches	the	roll	of	fat	that	has	settled	around
their	waist,	and	agrees.
You	 discover	 that	 yes,	 your	 YMCA	 membership	 card	 does	 still	 work	 even
though	 you	 haven’t	 set	 foot	 in	 the	 place	 for	 six	 years.	That	 first	 day	 on	 the
treadmill	goes	pretty	well,	and	you’re	feeling	so	optimistic,	you	hit	the	weights,
too.	 It	 makes	 for	a	 triumphant	 first	 three-minute	 video.	 Unfortunately,	 your

muscles	 revolt	 against	 the	 unusual	 physical	 activity	 by	 seizing	up	 on	 you	 so
badly	that	you’re	laid	out	flat	on	your	back	for	the	next	two	days.	You	film	your
next	two	videos	from	your	bed,	filling	in	your	two	fans	with	information	about
yourself,	your	feelings	about	dance,	and	why	you’re	embarking	on	this	project.
Those	two	fans	are	your	kids,	by	the	way.	Whatever.
You	 change	 your	 eating	 habits,	 you	 commit	 to	 the	 gym,	 and	 you	 start
attending	dance	lessons	twice	a	week.	Every	day,	you	film	a	vlog	post,	sharing
what	you’re	liking,	what	you’re	not,	your	diet	tips,	what	you	learned	in	class,
and	anything	else	you	think	might	be	of	interest	to	your	viewers.	After	a	month,
you	have	four	subscribers.	You’re	pretty	sure	the	two	new	ones	are	your	kids’
roommates.	Whatever.
For	 six	 months,	 you	 and	 your	 spouse	 continue	 on	 this	 journey	 of	 self-
improvement,	and	the	results	are	amazing.	Between	the	two	of	you,	you’ve	lost
twelve	pounds,	and	the	shared	experience	of	learning	new	things	together	has
rekindled	a	spark	that	had	faded	in	your	marriage.	You’re	having	tons	of	fun,	and
it	shows	in	your	videos.	You	don’t	know	who	all	those	subscribers	are	now,	but
while	talking	to	those	who	comment,	you’ve	figured	out	that	at	least	a	handful
are	older	relatives	of	the	students	sharing	your	kids’	dorms.
You	eventually	find	the	courage	to	sign	up	at	the	newcomer	level	in	a	local
dance	 competition,	 and	 while	 you	 don’t	 place	 at	the	 top,	 you	 don’t	 feel	 that
you’ve	embarrassed	yourself,	either.	Episode	489	shows	you	driving	six	hours	to
attend	 a	 statewide	competition,	 where	 you	 take	 home	 the	 Beginner	 bronze.
Ensuing	videos	document	your	journey	to	Championship	competitions,	as	well
as	the	transformation	of	your	marriage	from	ho-hum	to	hot	stuff.
Things	continue	to	get	better.	Over	the	course	of	two	years	of	training	and
vlogging,	you	pick	up	the	attention	of	thousands	of	people	who	are	inspired	by
your	 commitment	 to	 later-in-life	 fitness	 and	 a	 beautiful	 art	 form	 normally
associated	with	the	young	and	svelte.	You	and	your	spouse	are	anything	but,	but
people	love	watching	you	anyway.	Your	fans	help	you	pick	out	costumes,	make
workout	suggestions,	and	trade	dance	stories,	but	you	find	they’re	just	as	eager
to	talk	about	strategies	they’ve	used	to	reinvigorate	their	personal	relationships
as	they	are	about	your	hobby.	As	your	audience	has	grown,	you’ve	gotten	to
meet	some	of	your	fans,	and	you’re	stunned	at	how	pleased	they	are	to	meet	you
in	person,	how	they	want	to	pose	for	pictures	with	you	as	if	you’re	some	kind	of
television	star.	Your	following	gets	big	enough	that	you	think	it’s	worth	reaching
out	 to	 other	YouTube	 dance	 channels	 and	 asking	 if	 they’d	 be	 interested	 in
submitting	 some	 content	 to	 your	 page	 or	 doing	 an	 interview.	 Dance	schools,
dance	teachers,	fan	pages	for	So	You	Think	You	Can	Dance	and	Dancing	with	the
Stars,	and	dance-gear	brands,	dance	conferences,	and	competitions	start	reaching

out	to	ask	if	they	can	post	their	brands	or	make	appearances	on	your	show.	You
start	 getting	 sponsorship	 offers	 from	 workout-gear	 companies,	 theaters,	 and
sports	drinks.	By	day,	you	sell	insurance.	In	the	predawn	hours	and	late	at	night,
you	engage	and	biz-dev	while	your	partner	edits	video.	On	the	weekends,	you
dance.	Together,	you’re	having	the	time	of	your	lives.
It’s	been	six	years	since	you	started	this	project,	Sam.	You’re	now	fifty-eight
years	old,	and	your	income	has	nearly	doubled	now	that	it’s	subsidized	by	brands
associated	with	dance,	healthy	lifestyles,	and	personal	development.	You	think
you’ll	be	able	to	retire	from	your	insurance	job	in	a	year	or	two,	after	you’ve
earned	enough	to	pay	off	the	kids’	school	debt.	You	have	no	intention	of	ever
retiring	from	your	vlog,	though,	even	though	it	takes	a	lot	of	work	to	keep	up	the
momentum.	 Nothing	about	 this	 transformation	 has	 been	 easy,	 but	 it’s	 been
incredible	fun.
I	made	this	story	up,	but	it’s	not	fantasy.	You	can	do	it,	or	your	parents	can.
Hell,	your	grandparents	can.	It’s	a	scenario	that	could	be	replicated	in	real	life.	In
fact,	it’s	already	been	done.
YouTube	Best	Practices
If	you	want	to	increase	the	amount	of	time	people	spend	watching	every	video
you	post	on	your	channel	as	a	whole,	make	sure	you	can	answer	the	questions
below.
Video	Optimization
TITLES:	How	much	thought	have	you	put	into	your	video	title?	Does	the
title	accurately	reflect	the	video’s	content?	Is	the	majority	of	the	title
viewable	on	mobile?	Is	the	title	short	and	concise,	emotionally	driven,
and/or	keyword	optimized?
DESCRIPTIONS:	Are	the	top	two	lines	of	the	description	keyword
optimized?	Are	there	links	to	other	similar	videos	or	playlists	in	the
description?	Is	there	a	subscribe	link?	Are	there	links	to	your	other
social-media	accounts?	Are	all	of	the	links	clickable	and	trackable?
TAGS:	Are	there	at	least	ten	tags	in	the	description?	Are	both	one-word
and	phrase	tags	included?	Do	the	tags	accurately	reflect	the	video’s

content?	Are	the	tags	valuable,	that	is,	do	they	have	high	search	volumes
but	low	competition?	You	can	find	this	out	by	using	tools	like	VidIQ,
Google	Adwords	Keyword	Planner,	and	Keywordtool.io.
THUMBNAILS:	Does	the	thumbnail	accurately	reflect	the	video’s	content?
If	there	is	text	on	the	thumbnail,	is	it	easy	to	read	on	all	devices?	If	there
is	text,	does	it	complement	the	title?
YOUTUBE	CARDS:	To	extend	watch	time	on	your	channel,	are	you
including	YouTube	cards	within	your	video	to	drive	traffic	to	other
relevant	videos	you’ve	posted?
Channel	Optimization
BANNER:	Does	the	banner	accurately	reflect	the	channel’s	content	and
genre?	Does	the	graphic	transfer	well	to	all	devices?
ABOUT	SECTION/CHANNEL	DESCRIPTION:	Are	the	top	two	lines	keyword
optimized?	Is	the	first	paragraph	an	overview	of	the	channel?	Have	you
included	the	upload	schedule?	Are	all	of	the	social-media	links
clickable?	(They	don’t	have	to	be	trackable.)

Does	the	channel	trailer	accurately	reflect	the	channel’s	content	and
genre?	Is	the	channel	trailer	telling	the	best	story	in	the	shortest	amount
of	time?
How	I’m	Crushing	It
Daniel	Markham,	What’s	Inside?
IG:	@whatsinside
It’s	fitting	that	a	science	project	was	responsible	for	shifting
Daniel	Markham’s	career	from	pharmaceutical	sales	rep	to	half

of	a	world-traveling	father-son	duo	devoted	to	cutting	things	in
two.	Decades	of	testing,	experimentation,	and	life	experience	led
to	his	and	his	son’s	“overnight	success.”
Growing	up,	Dan	had	always	wanted	to	be	an	entrepreneur,
but	 upon	 graduating	 from	 college	 with	 a	 young	 family,	 he
applied	his	degree	in	global	business	and	finance	to	a	position	as
a	pharmaceutical	sales	rep.	The	money	was	good,	but	for	years
he	put	up	websites	and	dabbled	in	side	hustles,	or,	in	his	words,
“little	random	small	businesses	that	totally	failed,”	in	the	hopes
that	one	would	take	off	and	allow	him	to	leave	his	steady	job.
When	YouTube	came	along,	he	put	up	videos	of	his	kids	and
wife	to	share	with	the	rest	of	his	family,	who	didn’t	live	near
him	in	Utah.	He’d	always	monetized	his	websites	with	Google
AdSense,	throwing	up	little	pop-up	ads,	and	he	did	the	same	for
the	YouTube	videos	even	though	he’d	never	made	any	money
this	way.	No	one	was	watching.
One	 day	 his	 son,	 Lincoln,	 came	 to	 him	 for	 help	 with	 his
second-grade	 science	 project.	 The	 assignment:	 to	 ask	 and
answer	a	question	of	his	own	choosing.	The	year	before,	he’d
asked,	“Why	do	we	have	boogers?”	and	had	stuck	a	giant	nose
stuffed	 with	green	 goo	 on	 his	 poster-board	 presentation.	 This
year	he	was	interested	in	finding	out	why	humans	have	earwax,
but	 Dan	 felt	that	 was	 too	 similar.	 So	 after	 thinking	 about	 it,
Lincoln	decided	that	since	he	loved	sports,	he’d	like	to	find	out
what	was	inside	a	sports	ball.	With	his	father’s	help,	he	started
cutting	 balls	 in	 half	 and	 putting	 together	 his	 project.	 Dan
decided	to	 film	 the	 process,	 posting	 the	 results	 on	 one	 of	 his
YouTube	channels	that	he	renamed	Lincoln	Markham	to	make	it
easy	to	identify.	The	idea	was	that	after	making	his	presentation,
Lincoln	could	share	the	name	of	the	channel	with	his	teacher
and	classmates,	and	they	could	go	watch	it	on	their	own	time.
Dan	 had	 already	 monetized	 about	 eighty	 videos	 by	 then,
including	the	previous	year’s	booger	video,	playing	around	with
the	titles	and	tag	words	to	make	them	more	appealing,	He	added
this	one	to	the	lot.	It	was	January	2014.
Almost	a	year	later,	on	a	winter	day	in	December	2014,	Dan
got	 an	 AdSense	 notification	 that	 he’d	 earned	 four	 dollars.	 He
checked	his	 analytics.	 It	 hadn’t	 come	 from	 his	 websites.	 He
checked	YouTube.	Someone	was	watching,	enough	someones	to

generate	income.	Inexplicably,	YouTube	had	decided	it	liked	his
video	and	had	started	suggesting	it	when	people	were	watching
videos	 about	baseball.	 People	 were	 clicking	 on	 it,	 and	 some
were	commenting,	offering	suggestions	for	other	types	of	balls
Lincoln	 could	cut	 open.	 “Maybe	 this	 is	 it,”	 Dan	 thought.	 He
showed	Lincoln	what	was	happening	and	asked	him	if	he	was
interested	in	doing	some	more	videos.	Together,	they	decided	to
go	all	in.
They	hid	the	other	videos	on	the	channel,	changed	the	name
to	What’s	Inside?	and	started	cutting.	They’d	spend	four	or	five
hours	together	every	Saturday,	using	Dan’s	phone	to	film	videos
of	 themselves	 cutting	 open	 various	 types	 of	 balls,	 and	 Dan
would	 throw	 them	 up	 to	 the	 platform.	 As	 they	 learned	 more
about	 how	 the	 YouTube	 algorithm	 worked,	 they	 continued	 to
film	 on	Saturdays,	 even	 when	 they	 were	 traveling,	 but	 they
released	 only	 one	 video	 per	 week.	 The	 videos	 got	 better	 and
more	polished	as	Dan	taught	himself	to	use	Final	Cut	Pro	and
enhanced	the	storytelling	elements	of	the	videos.	For	example,
when	 they	 cut	up	 a	 football,	 they	 opened	 with	 footage	 of
themselves	throwing	a	football	around.	They	learned	even	more
by	 attending	 video	conferences	 and	 networking	 with	 other
YouTubers.	It	was	at	one	of	these	events,	the	first	CVX	Live,
that	 Dan	 heard	 adventure-and-extreme-sports	videographer
Devin	Graham,	aka	devinsupertramp,	announce	that	the	way	he
made	 money	 on	 YouTube	 was	 10	 percent	 from	 AdSense,	20
percent	from	licensing	content,	and	70	percent	from	sponsored
videos.	“It	just	completely	blew	my	mind.	I	was	like,	‘Oh,	my
gosh,	you	can	make	money	from	brands	that	would	wanna	put
their	stuff	on	there?’	That	was	new	to	me.”
It	was	summer	2015,	and	Dan	scored	his	first	brand	deal	by
making	a	pitch	on	a	website	called	FameBit,	a	marketing	site
where	brands	 post	 offers	 to	 pay	 creatives	 to	 promote	 their
products.	He	got	paid	around	$250	to	cut	open	a	Rubik’s	Cube,
and	 then	$1,000	 to	 cut	 open	 a	 mattress.	 “I	 thought	 we	 had	 it
made.	 A	 thousand	 dollars,	 and	 we’re	 just	 cutting	 open	 a
mattress!”
A	few	months	later,	he	met	Shaun	“Shonduras”	McBride	(see
Chapter	9),	who	told	him	that	with	their	channel’s	reach—they
now	had	 almost	 one	 million	 subscribers—they	 should	 be

pitching	 the	 advertising	 agencies	 that	 run	 big	 influencer
marketing	 campaigns.	“Back	 to	 the	 hustle.	 I	 had	 my	 day	 job
where	I	was	selling	drugs	and	I	was	traveling	to	eight	different
states.	And	I	would	sit	there	at	night	in	hotels	looking	up	the
people	who	spoke	at	VidCon,	the	biggest	video	conference	in
the	 country.	 Anybody	who	 looked	 like	 they	 were	 from	 an
advertising	 agency,	 I	 would	 Google	 them	 and	 find	 out	 what
company	 they	 worked	 for,	 and	 reach	out,	 either	 by	 e-mail	 or
their	Contact	Us	page.”
One	of	those	agencies	responded.	Dan	explained	that	if	they
were	looking	for	creative	ideas	for	their	brands,	he	and	Lincoln
would	love	to	work	with	them.	“‘We	are	family	friendly	and	we
cut	stuff	open.	It’s	like	an	unboxing	channel	on	steroids.’	And
they	said,	‘Well,	why	don’t	you	sign	this	NDA	and	we’ll	talk.’”
It	turned	out	the	agency	represented	Bill	and	Melinda	Gates.
What’s	Inside?	and	a	few	other	YouTube	channels	were	chosen
to	bring	attention	to	their	annual	letter	outlining	their	position	on
current	global	issues	and	challenging	people	to	work	for	positive
change	in	the	world.	The	theme	of	that	year’s	letter	was	“Two
Superpowers	 We	 Wish	 We	 Had.”	 Dan,	 who	 was	 born	 in	 the
Philippines,	spoke	Tagalog,	and	had	served	two	years	there	as	a
missionary	for	the	Church	of	Jesus	Christ	of	Latter-day	Saints
(LDS),	 decided	 that	 his	 superpower	 would	 be	 to	 bring	 clean,
drinkable	water	to	the	developing	world.	His	idea	was	to	bring
Lincoln	to	the	Philippines	to	show	him	why	the	lack	of	potable
water	was	such	a	serious	issue.
This	was	their	first	“big	brand”	deal,	and	it	was	an	important
moment.	“We	needed	to	keep	hustling	and	trying	to	find	brands
that	we	liked	and	that	we	wanted	to	work	with	that	would	make
sense	for	our	channel.	We	don’t	want	to	align	ourselves	with	a
brand	 that	 we	 don’t	 support	 ourselves.”	 This	 meant	 turning
down	deals,	sometimes	extremely	lucrative	ones.	Dan	is	proud
of	 Lincoln	 for	 talking	 sense	 into	 him	 when	 he	 had	 his	 head
turned	by	an	advertising	agency	that	offered	them	something	in
the	$30K-to-$50K	range	to	do	a	video	of	them	cutting	open	a
toy.	There	was	one	problem.
It	wasn’t	super	interesting.	If	we	cut	it	open,	people	would	think,	Why
did	I	watch	this?	But	honestly,	I	was	going	to	find	a	way	to	do	it.	I	told
Lincoln	about	it.	I	was	a	little	apprehensive,	but	it	was	good	money,	like

a	quarter	of	my	annual	salary	from	my	day	job.	And	Lincoln	said,	“No,
Dad,	absolutely	not.	We	would	totally	be	sellouts	if	 we	 did	 that.	 Our
audience	would	hate	it.”	And	as	soon	as	he	said	it,	I	was	like,	“You’re
totally	right.”	At	the	time	he	was	ten	years	old.
They	didn’t	do	it.	Instead,	they	posted	a	different	video	they
were	pretty	sure	would	also	disappoint	their	viewers.	It	was	of
them	cutting	open	a	rattlesnake	rattle.	They	had	traveled	to	the
Phoenix	Zoo	to	film	the	cut	as	part	of	the	opening	about	three
months	earlier,	but	they’d	never	posted	the	video	because	Dan
knew	from	his	research	that	it	would	be	anticlimactic—there’s
nothing	inside	a	rattlesnake	rattle.	But	they	had	no	other	videos
for	that	week	because	they’d	been	on	vacation,	so	they	decided
to	edit	the	ending	for	that	purpose,	even	though	they	were	tired
from	their	road	trip.	It	was	a	Saturday	night.	Dan	spent	about
seven	 hours	 editing	 and	 published	 the	 video	 a	 few	 minutes
before	leaving	for	church	the	next	morning.
That	post	became	the	third	most	viral	video	on	all	of	YouTube
in	 2016,	 racking	 up	 forty-two	 million	 views	 in	 its	 first	 seven
days.	 An	 entire	 new	 audience	 arrived,	 many	 of	 whom	 were
significantly	older	than	the	demographic	Dan	and	Lincoln	had
appealed	to	 before.	 Among	 them	 were	 people	 who	 worked	 at
advertising	agencies	and	brands.	Now	instead	of	hustling	until
three	a.m.	to	find	and	reach	out	to	big	marketing	players,	the	big
marketing	players	were	coming	to	Dan.
He	quit	his	sales	job	in	July	2016.
The	generation	that’s	my	age,	they	don’t	understand	social	media	at	all.
And	then	you	put	in	my	parents,	who	are	even	older.	For	me	to	say	I’m
leaving	a	really	good	job	that	took	me	a	long	time	to	get	to	where	I	am,
to	step	away	from	that	to	make	YouTube	videos,	they	were	definitely
scared,	even	when	I	told	them	the	numbers.	Those	conversations	were
hard,	because	you	don’t	want	to	feel	that	you’re	letting	people	down	or
that	people	are	worried	about	you.
His	wife,	who	had	always	been	supportive	but	liked	her	full-
time	 job	 working	 for	 a	 Fortune	 100	 company,	 quit	 when	 it
became	clear	that	the	family	balance	that	was	so	important	to
them	 couldn’t	 be	 sustained	 with	 both	 parents	 working	 such
intense	hours.	And	Lincoln?	Lincoln	still	makes	videos	with	his
dad,	but	he	also	goes	to	school,	plays	golf,	and	hangs	with	his
friends	and	sisters	like	any	normal	boy.	Dan	is	adamant	about

protecting	 his	 son’s	 childhood,	 and	 his	 daughters’	 now	 that
they’re	 running	a	 family	 channel,	 too.	 He	 keeps	 a	 healthy
perspective	about	the	magical	ride	his	family	is	enjoying.
I	want	Lincoln	to	feel	like	he	is	still	a	kid,	not	like	he	has	a	full-time	job.
I’m	looking	at	a	pile	of	twenty	things	that	would	be	awesome	and	timely
and	good	to	cut	open	right	now,	but	I	want	Lincoln	to	get	home	from
school	and	go	play	with	his	friends	today,	so	I’m	not	going	to	do	that.	It’s
a	tricky	balance.
Nike	e-mails	and	says,	“We	want	Lincoln	to	be	one	of	the	top	global
influencers	for	this	campaign.”	Whether	or	not	Lincoln	is	a	top	global
influencer—and	I	have	a	hard	time	thinking	that	he	is—the	fact	that	Nike
thinks	he	is	is	something	Lincoln	has	on	his	résumé	that	will	never	go
away.	I’ve	done	a	lot	of	talking	about	brand	deals	and	hustling	to	get
those	brand	deals,	but	at	the	end	of	the	day,	meeting	Bill	Gates	for	that
first	 video	 .	 .	 .	 forget	 about	 the	 money.	 It	 will	 forever	 go	 down	 as
something	that	we’ve	done	as	a	family.	This	is	all	stuff	that	if	YouTube
went	away	tomorrow,	has	been	amazing	life	experiences.
You	never	know	what	is	going	to	take	off	in	life.	Definitely	nothing	is
going	 to	 take	 off	 if	 you	 are	 not	 consistently	 working	hard	 and	 trying
different	things	forever.	I	never	thought	that	I’d	be	cutting	things	open,
but	if	I	didn’t	try	and	fail	at	all	these	other	things	for	all	those	years,	this
would	never	have	come	about.
Dan	Markham	and	his	family	are	practitioners.	They	did	their
research,	 they	 paid	 attention	 to	 all	 the	 little	 details,	 and	they
stayed	 true	 to	 their	 brand.	 It’s	 exciting	 to	 me	 to	 see	 a	 family
doing	so	well	because	they	put	in	the	work—and	executed.

Facebook
Facebook	remains	the	juggernaut	of	the	social-media	game,	a	platform	on	par
with	YouTube	for	personal	brand	building	and	wealth	creation.	That	may	come
as	 a	 surprise	 to	 a	 few	 readers.	 Facebook	 is	 often	 thought	 of	 as	 the	 old-fogy
platform,	the	place	where	Boomers	and	Gen	Xers	share	pictures	of	their	families
and	fill	out	questionnaires	to	find	out	which	GoT	character	they	most	resemble,
not	the	place	where	the	young	generation	is	spending	its	time	and	money.	That’s
just	not	the	case.	Here’s	the	reality:	if	you’re	going	to	build	a	personal	brand	and
try	to	monetize	it,	you	have	to	have	a	Facebook	page.	Period.	It	has	almost	2
billion	monthly	active	users,	more	than	half	of	whom	use	it	daily.
1
	There	are	1.15
billion	daily	active	users	on	mobile.
2
	If	you’re	crushing	it	on	Snapchat,	YouTube,
or	Instagram	but	don’t	have	a	full-throttle	Facebook	strategy,	you’re	severely
limiting	your	potential	and	growth.

Facebook	101
There	are	a	few	reasons	for	this.	First,	unlike	any	other	platform,	Facebook	gives
you	 the	 gift	 of	 flexibility.	 Written	 content	and	 photographs	 don’t	 work	 on
YouTube.	Instagram	allows	for	a	maximum	of	one-minute	videos	on	a	user’s
main	page	at	the	time	of	this	writing.	There’s	no	way	long	written	content	is
getting	traction	on	Snapchat,	but	on	Facebook	a	thirteen-paragraph	blog	post	will
work.	You	can	post	pictures,	and	they’ll	work.	You	can	embed	a	SoundCloud
audio	play,	and	it	will	work.	A	thirteen-second	video	will	work.	So	will	a	thirty-
one-minute	video.	Facebook	offers	complete	and	utter	creative	flexibility	and
has	 the	 greatest	ad-targeting	 product	 ever	 created.	 No	 one	 is	 too	 cool	 for
Facebook.	If	you	haven’t	already	done	so,	go	to	Facebook	right	now	and	register
your	 fan	 page,	 because	 even	 if	 it’s	 not	 the	 place	 where	 you	 create	 the	 pillar
content	for	your	personal	brand,	it	is	where	everything	you	do	on	every	other
platform	will	come	to	live	for	the	remainder	of	your	personal	brand’s	existence.
Facebook	is	not	only	a	canvas	where	you	can	create	original	content,	but	also
an	imperative	distribution	channel.	The	DNA	of	Facebook	is	word	of	mouth.	It
is	 the	 place	 where	 sharing	 culture	 has	 thrived	 beyond	 measure.	 On	 other
platforms,	you	generally	either	hit	a	grand	slam	or	you	strike	out.	Not	so	on
Facebook.	There,	with	sixty-one	shares,	you’re	getting	at	least	a	single	every
day.	If	you’re	good	at	creating	content,	on	another	day	you	could	hit	a	double
with	two	hundred	shares.	You	might	drop	down	to	thirteen	shares	with	the	next
piece	 of	 content,	 only	 to	 follow	 up	 with	 something	 spectacular	 that	 gets	 you
seven	 thousand.	With	 every	 share,	 no	 matter	 how	 micro,	 you’re	 building
awareness	 of	 your	 brand	 in	 a	 native	 way.	 If	 anything,	 it’s	 the	 best	place	for
people	with	no	followers	to	begin	their	personal	branding	efforts.
Because	of	its	incredibly	detailed	targeting	capabilities—you	can	specify	your
audience	 by	 their	 interests,	 of	 course,	 but	also	 by	 their	 zip	 codes	 or	 their
employers—Facebook	 is	 also	 an	 incredible	 place	 for	 someone	 with	 a	 small
budget.	 It’s	 an	 insanely	valuable	 platform	 when	 a	 nobody	 launching	 her
fashionista	brand	has	to	spend	only	thirteen	dollars	to	boost	or	target	her	post	of
a	pretty	top	and	conceivably	get	as	many	as	2,600	impressions,	depending	on	her
targeting	choices.	(An	“impression”	is	electronically	recorded	each	time	an	ad	is
displayed	on	a	user’s	screen.)	The	cost	per	thousand	impressions	(CPM,	the	M
standing	for	mille,	Latin	for	“thousand”)	fluctuates	with	the	market,	 but	 right
now	it	is	still	one	of	the	cheapest	yet	most	effective	ad	products	in	existence,

comparable	to	Google	Adwords	back	in	the	early	aughts.	That	won’t	always	be
the	case.	Eighteen	months	after	this	book	is	published,	Facebook	ad	prices	will
have	doubled	or	more.	Take	advantage	of	this	wide-open	runway	while	you	still
can	and	jump-start	your	brand	awareness.
Finally,	as	big	as	YouTube	is,	by	the	time	this	book	is	published,	Facebook
will	be	emerging	as	a	fierce	competitor	in	video.	Mark	Zuckerberg	called	video	a
“mega	trend”	of	the	same	nature	as	mobile
3
	and	has	made	it	clear	that	video	is
Facebook’s	future.	In	2016,	he	told	BuzzFeed,	“I	wouldn’t	be	surprised	if	you
fast-forward	five	years	and	most	of	the	content	that	people	see	on	Facebook	and
are	sharing	on	a	day-to-day	basis	is	video.”
4
	When	Facebook	wants	something	to
work,	it	puts	all	its	support	behind	it.	The	effect	on	the	social-media	landscape	is
generally	something	like	a	tectonic	plate	shift	(the	platform	is	in	the	process	of
working	out	deals	to	produce	original	content	in	partnerships	with	millennial-
friendly	outlets	like	Group	Nine	Media,	producer	of	The	Dodo,	and	Vox	Media).
5
Knowing	that,	wouldn’t	it	be	foolish	to	bypass	the	opportunity	to	get	in	early?
You	might	be	thinking,	I	already	make	YouTube	videos.	I’ll	just	put	them	on
Facebook.	Two	birds,	one	stone,	done.	Not	so	fast.	Facebook’s	algorithm	will
always	 give	 preferential	 treatment	 to	 native	 Facebook	 content.	 You’ll	 get	 far
greater	reach	 by	 creating	 an	 original	 video	 for	 Facebook	 than	 by	 recycling
something	from	another	platform.	Does	the	video	have	great	copy	alongside	it?
Are	the	first	three	seconds	captivating?	Does	it	show	an	understanding	of	the
mind-set	of	the	Facebook	demographic	that	would	love	to	share	it	with	a	family
member	or	friend?	Does	it	compel	an	action	right	there	and	then?	Video	is	still
something	 of	 a	 novelty	 on	 Facebook,	 which	 means	 it	 has	 the	 potential	 to	 be
noticed	 faster	 and	 get	 greater	 engagement	than	 whatever	 you	 might	 post	 on
YouTube.
That	 doesn’t	 mean	 you	 shouldn’t	 post	 on	 YouTube	 or	 anywhere	 else,	 of
course,	but	do	not	underestimate	the	power	that	doubling	down	on	Facebook
could	have	on	your	brand.	Facebook	is	the	first	platform	that	has	combined	the
ability	to	do	marketing,	sales,	and	branding	all	in	one	place,	and	it	is	still	vastly
underpriced	for	the	amount	of	attention	you	can	get	there	from	its	nearly	two
billion	monthly	users.

Facebook	201
Facebook	Live.	Facebook	has	gone	all	in	on	Live,	trying	to	give	users	a	place	to
indulge	in	the	raw,	immediate	experience	of	engaging	directly	with	viewers	in
real	time.	It’s	powerful	stuff,	but	be	aware	that	live	video	is	the	hardest	art	form.
If	you	eliminate	the	news,	sports,	awards	shows,	and	Saturday	Night	Live,	there
are	very	few	live	TV	shows,	and	for	good	reason.	It	takes	enormous	skill	to
captivate	an	audience	enough	to	disrupt	their	routine	at	the	moment	you	want
their	attention.	That’s	a	much	bigger	ask	than	trying	to	get	people	to	watch	you
on	their	own	time.	And	yet,	the	spontaneity	can	really	work	in	your	favor.	If	you
can	crystallize	a	special	moment	and	share	it	with	your	fans	in	real	time,	it	can
become	something	truly	special	to	them,	too.	Just	ask	Candace	Payne	of	Dallas.
Never	heard	of	her?	You	might	know	her	better	as	Chewbacca	Mom.	On	May
19,	 2016,	 Payne	 opened	 up	 Facebook	 Live	 to	 show	 her	Facebook	 friends	 a
present	she	bought	for	herself—a	roaring	Chewbacca	mask.	She	was	so	excited,
she	couldn’t	even	wait	to	get	home;	she	filmed	from	inside	her	car	while	still
sitting	in	the	Kohl’s	parking	lot.	She	titled	the	post	“It’s	the	Simple	Joys	in	Life.”
It	was	a	funny	look,	but	what	really	caught	people’s	attention	was	her	infectious,
unstoppable	 laughter	 as	she	 delighted	 in	 her	 purchase.	 Maybe	 people	 were
feeling	 jaded;	 maybe	 they	 were	 weary	 of	 heavy	 content	 about	 upcoming
elections	and	other	serious	topics.	For	whatever	reason,	the	people	who	saw	the
post	loved	it	so	much,	they	started	sharing	it,	and	so	did	everyone	else	who	saw
it.	With	162	million	views	as	of	December	2016,	it	became	the	most	popular
Facebook	Live	video	of	that	year.
6
	As	many	have	pointed	out,	the	vast	majority
of	the	people	who	saw	that	video	viewed	it	long	after	it	was	no	longer	live,	but
the	live	format	is	what	made	that	moment	possible.	Had	Payne	known	she	was
posting	for	posterity,	she	might	have	been	more	self-conscious.	She	might	have
planned	in	her	head	what	she	was	going	to	say.	Instead,	she	just	opened	up	the
phone	and	started	filming	with	her	guard	down,	allowing	her	personality	to	shine
as	bright	as	two	Tatooine	suns.	You	can’t	get	more	authentic,	and	people	fell
head	over	heels.	For	a	little	while,	she	was	part	of	the	celebrity	circuit,	appearing
on	talk	shows	and	being	featured	in	the	media.	She	was	rewarded	handsomely	by
Kohl’s	with	thousands	of	dollars’	worth	of	gift	cards	and	merchandise
7
	and	she
was	 invited	 to	 meet	 Mark	 Zuckerberg	 at	 Facebook.	 Hasbro,	 which	 made	 the
original	Wookie	mask,	presented	her	with	a	custom-made	action	figure	with	her
head	(in	a	removable	mask)	attached	to	a	Wookie	body.
8
	But	what’s	really	cool	is

how	Payne	used	her	fifteen	minutes	of	fame	to	continue	building	her	brand	as	a
positive,	deeply	religious	person	dedicated	to	spreading	hope,	joy,	and	optimism.
She	 landed	 a	 TLCme	 video	 series,	 and	 her	 website	 revealed	a	 long	 list	 of
speaking	engagements.	She	signed	a	multibook	deal.
9
	Her	first	book,	Laugh	It
Up,	published	in	November	2017,	was	written,	she	said	in	a	video	she	made
while	preparing	to	send	her	manuscript	to	her	editor,	“for	those	of	you	who	think
that	joy	is	a	frivolous	thing	that	you	don’t	deserve.”
10
Candace	Payne’s	story	is	the	stuff	of	dreams,	the	kind	of	moment	that	can’t	be
planned.	 That’s	 why	 I	 wouldn’t	 recommend	 Facebook	Live	 for	 most	 people
unless	they’ve	perfected	their	video	technique	and	seen	success	for	a	few	years
and	are	ready	to	up	their	game.	It’s	not	generally	the	place	to	start	from	zero,
because	the	experience	might	be	a	bit	like	a	first-time	rider	jumping	on	a	bike
without	 training	 wheels.	 For	 those	 of	 you	 who	 are	 ready,	 though,	 Live	 could
capture	a	one-in-a-million	moment	that	you	never	saw	coming	and	put	you	on
the	map.*	John	Lee	Dumas,	creator	of	Entrepreneurs	on	Fire,	is	a	believer,	too.
Without	 a	 doubt,	 Facebook	 Live	 is	 the	 next	 thing.	 I’m	 having	 incredible	 success	 using
platforms	like	Wirecast	and	BeLive.tv,	which	are	just	tools	that	allow	me	to	sit	at	my	computer
and	do	a	Facebook	Live,	but	they	also	have	text	overlay,	pull	people’s	comments	in,	and	have
full-show	interaction.	And	just	the	engagement	that	I’m	having,	the	real	time–ness—it’s	just
been	a	different	level.
Everybody’s	there;	they	get	that	little	blip	notification.	“Hey,	John’s	hanging	out	live	right
now.”	I	actually	call	it	Tea	with	JLD	just	as	a	cute	little	rhyme.	I	pour	a	cup	of	tea,	I	sit	on
Facebook	Live,	and	I	usually	go	on	a	rant	about	some	topic	for	five	or	ten	minutes,	and	then	I
start	answering	questions.	Just	hanging	out—could	be	thirty	minutes,	could	be	an	hour—and
I’ll	get	hundreds	of	comments	and	thousands	and	thousands	of	views,	all	just	from	flipping	on
Facebook	Live.	So	to	me,	that’s	where	it’s	at	right	now.	Facebook	Live	is	where	the	attention
is.
Collaborate.	 If	 you	 are	 building	 a	 brand	 based	 on	 jokes,	 cooking,	 bikes,
extreme	sports,	or	bathing	suits—anything—go	to	the	top	of	Facebook	and	do
searches	on	terms	that	are	relevant	to	your	business.	Find	the	fan	pages	with	the
most	followers,	message	them,	and	make	them	an	incredible	offer	that	makes	it
worth	their	while	to	share	your	original	content	on	their	platform	or	to	work	with
you	in	other	ways.	For	example,	if	you’re	a	biker	and	you	get	a	viral	hit	on	your
post	about	how	a	motorcycle	helmet	saved	your	life,	the	best	thing	you	could	do
would	be	to	spend	hours	getting	in	touch	with	every	single	popular	motorcycle
fan	page	and	offering	them	a	brilliantly	funny	PSA	about	helmets	to	share	on
their	 page.	 Collaborating	 through	 Facebook	 is	a	 strategic	 move	 that	 has
enormous	potential	to	quickly	build	your	audience.

Imagine	This
Let’s	say	you’re	a	newly	divorced	forty-two-year-old	real	estate	agent	named
Sally	living	in	Sacramento,	California.	There	are	so	many	people	buying	and
selling	properties	out	there.	How	are	you	going	to	stand	out?
You	start	by	creating	a	pillar	piece	of	content.	In	this	case,	your	ideal	pillar
would	be	a	weekly	audio	podcast	that	people	can	listen	to	as	they	drive	around
town	scoping	out	neighborhoods.	Biweekly	would	be	OK,	and	monthly	would
be	better	than	nothing,	but	you	know	that	the	more	content	you	put	out,	the	more
opportunities	you	can	create.	(Stay	with	me	here—you’ll	see,	Facebook	is	the
star	in	this	story.)
Your	podcast	explores	the	minutiae	of	daily	living	in	and	around	Sacramento
and	establishes	you	as	the	“virtual-content	mayor”	of	the	city.	Local	residents
tune	 in	 to	 hear	 your	 take	 on	 their	 beloved	 city.	 One	 day	 you	 might	 review
restaurants	and	local	dishes,	on	another	you’ll	dig	into	the	history	of	the	city,	and
on	another	you’ll	interview	local	influencers.	From	then	on,	whenever	anyone
wants	to	know	more	about	Sacramento	or	its	future,	everyone	knows	you’re	the
person	to	contact,	because	you’ve	made	it	clear	that	no	one	knows	the	city	better
or	loves	it	more	than	you.
As	you’re	doing	your	stories	about	the	people,	places,	or	things	that	make
Sacramento	a	unique,	vibrant	place	to	live,	you	take	notes	and	highlight	details
from	 each	 podcast	 that	 can	 be	 turned	 into	 ancillary	 pieces	 of	 content.	 For
example,	 if	 you	interview	 the	 superintendent	 of	 the	 school	 district	 and	 he
mentions	that	five	of	its	teachers	recently	received	prestigious	national	awards,
you’ve	found	another	piece	of	content.	Track	down	those	five	teachers,	take	their
picture,	 and	 create	 a	 Facebook	post	 that	 asks,	 “Did	 you	 know	 that	 five
Sacramento	 School	 District	 teachers	 have	 been	 nationally	 recognized	 for
excellence	in	education?”	You	include	a	link	to	your	podcast	interview	with	the
school	 superintendent.	 More	 and	 more	 Sacramentans	 learn	who	 you	 are	 and
become	regular	listeners.	When	one	of	them	finds	out	that	his	friend’s	family	is
moving	to	town	because	his	wife	got	a	job	transfer,	he	forwards	the	podcast	link
so	they	can	learn	more	about	the	school	district.	Suddenly,	a	family	who	will
need	to	buy	a	home	has	your	voice	in	their	ear	and	your	contact	information	at
their	fingertips.	That	cycle	repeats	over	and	over	until,	within	five	years,	you’re
so	 established	 as	 the	 primo	 real	 estate	 expert	 of	 Sacramento	 that	 your	 new
business	comes	in	almost	exclusively	by	referral.
Then	you	make	more	content.	You	go	out	and	film	or	photograph	the	places
you	talk	about	in	each	podcast	and	post	the	files	to	Facebook.	You	link	your

podcast	to	the	images,	so	that	now	people	who	don’t	already	live	in	the	city	can
see	for	themselves	what	these	areas	look	like	without	having	to	go	anywhere	else
on	the	Internet.
Now,	who	the	hell	is	going	to	see	this	content	when	you’re	brand-new	to	the
business	and	 have	 only	 twelve	 followers,	 most	of	 whom	 are	 family?	 Lots	 of
people,	because	Facebook	is	the	one	place	where	you	can	spend	unbelievably
smart	 advertising	 dollars.	Their	 targeting	 is	 unparalleled.	 You	 could	 spend
maybe	 fifty	 bucks	 against	 all	 twenty-five-to-seventy-two-year-old	 Facebook
users	who	live	in	Sacramento	and	potentially	reach	about	ten	thousand	people.
The	 details	 of	 the	 platform	 and	 its	 targeting	capabilities	 are	 changing	 all	 the
time,	so	you	Google	“How	to	run	a	Facebook	ad”	to	get	the	most	current	rates
and	 practices.	Then,	 when	 people	 start	 commenting	 on	 your	 page	 or	 your
content,	you	answer	every	single	one,	every	single	time	(read	The	Thank	You
Economy).	 When	 you’ve	 got	 no	 audience,	 you	 should	 be	 taking	 every
opportunity	 to	 engage	 with	 people	 who	 are	 taking	 an	 interest	 in	you.	 To	 do
otherwise	is	absolutely	bonkers.	The	fact	that	this	needs	to	be	said	speaks	to
many	people’s	audacity	and	laziness.
A	podcast	would	be	the	best	pillar	for	a	real	estate	agent,	but	if	you	just	can’t
get	comfortable	with	that	but	you’re	an	excellent	writer,	your	pillar	should	be	a
weekly	post	for	your	blog,	This	Week	in	Sacramento,	where	you	share	all	the
same	information	 I	 suggested	 for	 the	 podcast	 in	 written	 form,	 plus	 local	 real
estate	news	updates.	Now	you’re	not	just	the	virtual-content	mayor	of	the	city,
but	you’re	its	newspaper,	too.
You	 write	 a	 piece	 about	 the	 oldest	 doughnut	 shop	 in	 town.	 The	 owner
mentioned	that	he	was	nervous	about	the	new	Walmart	slated	for	construction
right	next	door.	You	post	that	doughnut	article.	Then	you	draw	(or	pay	someone
twenty	 dollars	 to	 draw)	 a	sketch	 of	 the	 corner	 where	 the	 doughnut	 shop	 is
located,	with	a	big	Walmart	logo	drawn	in.	You	post	that	arresting	image	on	your
Facebook	feed	as	well;	it’s	striking	enough	that	anyone	who	cares	about	the	shop
or	about	Sacramento	might	stop	to	study	it	more	carefully	as	it	scrolls	through
their	feed.	People	click	the	link	attached	to	your	blog	post,	which	raises	their
awareness	of	who	you	are	and	what	you	do.
As	 a	 real	 estate	 agent,	 your	 pillar	 could	 also	 be	 a	 reality	 show	 like	 my
DailyVee.	You	hire	an	intern	or	professional	videographer	to	follow	you	around
as	you	show	homes,	have	meetings,	negotiate	deals,	and	interact	with	colleagues,
as	well	as	while	you	attend	your	son’s	baseball	game	or	shop	at	the	supermarket.
You	basically	film	a	daily	love	letter	(and	occasional	complaint,	if	necessary)	to
the	city	where	you	live	and	work,	and	share	that	love	with	your	viewers,	reality-
star	style.

Once	you	get	comfortable	with	video,	Sally,	you	try	your	hand	at	Facebook
Live.	 Every	 Thursday	 from	 eight	 to	 nine	 p.m.,	 Sacramentans	and	 potential
Sacramentans	can	find	you	in	front	of	the	camera	ready	to	answer	any	questions
they	 may	 have	 about	 the	 real	estate	 market,	 neighborhoods,	 schools,	 doctors,
tattoo	parlors	.	.	.	all	the	people	and	places	that	make	up	a	community.	People
enjoy	being	a	part	of	your	show,	and	you	get	to	spread	your	knowledge,	help
people	out,	and	build	your	brand.	Everyone	benefits.
You	post	each	video	to	Facebook,	then	extract	pieces	to	create	hundreds	of
minivideos,	like	how	to	negotiate	a	contract,	what	to	look	for	when	touring	a
house,	and	home	styling	tips	for	the	first-time	seller.
While	you’re	busy	posting	original	content	on	Facebook,	you’re	also	joining
as	many	Facebook	communities	as	you	can.	You’ll	join	the	national	ones	for	real
estate	agents,	of	course,	but	you	also	want	to	join	the	Sacramento	mom	groups—
but	not	to	sell,	because	you	know	that	you	should	never	ask	for	anything	until
you’ve	 given	 twice	 as	 much	 or	 more	 than	 you’re	 hoping	 to	 get.*	 You	 join
because	you’re	a	mom	or	because	you	want	to	be	a	mom	or	because	you	have
nieces	and	nephews	and	want	to	stay	on	top	of	mom	talk	for	them.	If	you’re
raising	a	family,	you	join	other	family-oriented	groups.	If	you	golf,	you	join	the
golfing	groups.	If	you	like	Pokémon	Go,	you	join	the	Pokémon	Go	Sacramento
group.	Get	involved	in	all	the	lighthearted	aspects	of	the	city.	If	you	engage	like
crazy	and	build	your	personal	brand	properly,	people	will	learn	that	you’re	a	real
estate	agent,	but	they	won’t	shy	away	from	you,	because	they’ll	know	you	as	a
human	being	first,	just	as	they	would	if	they’d	met	you	in	person.	Once	you
become	 an	 influencer	 within	 these	 groups,	 members	 will	 check	 out	 your
Facebook	business	page	and	contact	you	when	they’re	ready	to	sell	or	buy	a
home.
This	 strategy	 sounds	 like	 a	 hell	 of	 a	 lot	 more	 work	 than	 just	 posing	 for	 a
picture	in	front	of	a	cute	house	while	holding	an	Open	House	sign,	doesn’t	it?	It
sounds	a	lot	more	interesting,	too.	Which	strategy	do	you	think	is	going	to	attract
the	attention	and	loyalty	of	more	consumers?	You	know	the	answer.
How	I’m	Crushing	It
Brittney	Castro,	Financially	Wise	Women
IG:	@brittneycastro

Brittney	Castro	is	creating	a	personal	brand	in	one	of	those
industries	that	pretty	much	discourages	it	at	every	turn:	personal
finance.	She’d	originally	wanted	to	be	an	event	planner,	because
she	liked	socializing	and	working	with	people.	Math	had	always
come	 easily	 to	 her,	 but	 she	 thought	 finance	 would	 be	 a	 dry,
boring	 career.	 Yet	 when	 she	 was	 offered	 a	 job	 as	 a	 financial
advisor,	her	career	counselor	suggested	that	the	two	fields	might
have	more	in	common	than	she	realized,	because	both	involved
helping	people,	and	said	that	she’d	never	know	for	sure	until	she
tried	it.	So	she	went	to	work	at	a	large	corporate	firm,	where	for
five	 years	 she	 clocked	 sixty	 to	 seventy	 hours	 per	 week.	 Her
counselor	was	right—she	did	like	the	work.	What	she	didn’t	like
was	 the	 stress	 and	 the	 corporate	 environment.	 “A	 lot	 of	 that
lifestyle	just	didn’t	match	up	with	who	I	naturally	was.	I	was
sick	all	the	time	because	I	was	trying	to	be	somebody	I’m	not.	I
think	 it	 was	 that	 internal	 pressure	 of	 following	 the	 path	that
you’re	told	to	follow	in	life	and	realizing,	this	is	not	leading	me
to	a	happy	life.”
As	 the	 Great	 Recession	 hit,	 she	 started	 reading	 personal-
development	books;	if	she	was	going	to	work	for	a	big	chunk	of
her	life,	she	figured	she’d	better	find	something	that	she	enjoyed
doing.	At	the	same	time,	she	noticed	that	women	were	starting
YouTube	 channels	 devoted	 to	 beauty,	 makeup,	 and	 fashion,
“And	I	thought,	Whoa,	that	looks	so	fun.”
She	 realized	 that	 she	 did	 want	 to	 stay	 in	 finance—“I	 just
needed	more	freedom	to	do	it	in	a	way	that	felt	authentic	to	me.”
She	set	her	sights	on	becoming	the	next	Suze	Orman.
She’s	great,	but	she’s	for	an	older	demographic.	I’m	a	woman,	I’m	in
finance—there’s	not	too	many	of	us—I’m	young,	and	I’m	half	Hispanic,
I	better	freaking	play	this	up!	It	was	a	process	though,	because	for	so
long,	especially	in	finance	and	law,	you’re	taught,	“No,	you	can’t,	you
can’t,	you	can’t.”	It	was	almost	like	breaking	out	of	a	shell	and	learning
to	 find	 my	 own	voice,	 learning	 how	 to	 be	 authentic	 online,	 but	 still
professional.	It’s	taken	me	years	to	find	that	comfort	level.
The	self-professed	“business	nerd”	also	fed	on	a	steady	diet	of
marketing	and	branding	books.	She	read	Crush	It!	right	around
the	 time	 that	 she	 moved	 to	 an	 independent	 firm	 where	 there
would	be	more	freedom	to	leverage	an	individual	brand.	In	2011
she	launched	a	blog,	a	Facebook	page,	a	YouTube	channel,	and	a

Twitter	account.	“I	had	to	explain	to	them,	it’s	the	same	thing	as
going	 to	 a	 workshop	 and	 teaching	 about	 money.	 The	 only
difference	is,	it’s	a	video	on	my	YouTube	channel.	It	was	just
turning	what	I	was	doing	offline,	online.”	But	she	still	had	to	get
every	 tweet	 and	 script	 preapproved.	 And	 yet,	“even	 though	 it
was	 a	 headache,	 it	 taught	 me	 how	 to	 be	 very	 thoughtful	 and
intentional,	and	not	just	throw	up	stuff	for	the	sake	of	it.”
Two-and-a-half	years	later,	Brittney	left	the	firm	to	start	her
own	business,	Financially	Wise	Women,	catering	to	women	and
couples	in	their	thirties	and	forties.
Not	everyone	was	impressed,	but	she	didn’t	care.	In	fact,	the
more	her	peers	disapproved,	the	more	she	knew	she	was	on	the
right	 path.	 For	 example,	 in	 2015	 she	 launched	 a	 finance	 rap
video	on	YouTube.
A	lot	of	financial	advisors	e-mailed	me	or	commented	to	say,	“This	is	so
unprofessional,”	and,	“You’re	using	your	CFP,	your	certified	financial
planner	 mark,	 in	 a	 way	 that’s	 not	 appropriate.”	 I	 do	 want	 to	 stay
respectful,	and	I	do	use	a	compliance	person,	but	when	that	feedback
came,	I	was	like,	“Yes!	That’s	exactly	what	I	want	to	hear,	because	the
video	was	not	made	for	you.	You’re	an	old	white	guy	in	Wisconsin.	This
is	for	urban	teenagers	who	like	to	watch	BuzzFeed	videos.	I’m	teaching
them	money	principles	in	a	fun	and	playful	way.	And	they	love	it.”	I
think	there	is	some	validity	in	listening	to	what	others	are	saying,	but	I
have	to	stay	true	to	who	I	am	and	ultimately	what	my	vision	is	for	my
business	and	my	life.
Today	 she’s	 on	 all	 the	 expected	 channels,	 but	 surprisingly,
Facebook	Live	is	a	personal	favorite.	“I	love	live	content.	It’s
easy	 for	 me	 to	 set	 up	 a	 Facebook	 Live,	 connect	 with	 people,
answer	their	questions.	I	think	it	brings	them	the	most	value	and
makes	 it	 the	 most	 real	 for	 them.”	 She	 not	 only	 conducts
Facebook	 Live	 sessions	 within	 her	 own	 Facebook	 groups	 and
community,	but	has	also	done	them	with	her	brand	partners,	like
Chase	and	Entrepreneur.	She	hopes	one	day	to	create	an	online
live-stream	video	show	that	leverages	all	the	communities	she
works	with.
In	the	meantime,	while	some	in	her	industry	lob	criticism	at
her,	she’s	in	demand	as	a	consultant	to	other	firms	and	advisors
interested	 in	 learning	 more	 about	 how	 to	 market	 and	 brand
themselves,	even	if	only	within	a	corporate	structure.	She	also
accepts	 a	 number	 of	 paid	 speaking	 opportunities	 each	 year.

Other	than	that,	she’s	got	her	head	down.
I	actually	don’t	even	care	what	others	are	doing	in	the	industry.	I	never
even	really	look.	I	just	work	on	my	company	and	my	brand.	Unless	I	go
speak	 at	 a	 conference,	 I	 really	 don’t	 connect	 with	 a	 lot	 of	 financial
advisors.	And	I	did	that	strategically,	because	 when	 I	 first	 started	 the
company,	there	was	just	so	much	outside	noise.	It’s	draining.	It	works	a
lot	better	because	I’m	not	constantly	comparing	myself,	or	competing.	I
need	to	just	do	me.
Though	I	don’t	know	Brittney,	of	all	the	contributors	in	this
book,	she’s	the	one	that	means	the	most	to	me.	People	working
in	industries	like	pharma	and	law	like	to	point	the	finger	at	strict
regulations	 to	 explain	 why	 they’re	 not	 crushing	 it	 on	social
media.	But	as	you	can	see,	where	there’s	a	will,	there’s	a	way.
Brittney’s	success	proves	that	when	you	take	the	time	and	effort
to	learn	how	to	navigate	toward	your	goals	while	still	following
the	rules,	you	can	go	forward	without	fear.

Instagram
Except	for	YouTube,	Instagram	has	created	more	famous	people	than	any	other
platform.	 It’s	 massive,	 it’s	 a	 place	 where	 you	can	 be	 equally	 successful	 as	 a
content	producer	or	a	content	curator,	and	it’s	the	hottest	social	network	in	terms
of	scale	and	impact.	Some	would	say	it’s	gotten	harder	to	get	noticed	there	now
that	it’s	crowded;	it’s	gotten	so	popular	that	college	graduates	are	actually	taking
a	 year	 or	 two	 to	 see	 if	 they	 can	 get	 big	 on	 Instagram	 before	 trying	 to	 get	 a
traditional	job.	It’s	not	as	flexible	as	Facebook,	though	I	predict	that	very	soon	it
will	 remove	 the	 time	 limits	 on	 videos.	 Although	 its	 content	is	 bite-size	 like
Twitter’s,	nothing	in	its	structure	makes	it	ideal	for	having	conversations.	Yet
there	 are	 so	 many	 great	tactics	 you	 can	 use	 to	 garner	 awareness—hashtags,
collaborations,	tagging,	ads—that	I	believe	the	attention	an	influencer	can	enjoy
here,	especially	skilled	photographers,	chefs,	designers,	and	other	artists,	runs
deeper	than	on	Twitter	or	Facebook.	I	know	it’s	true	for	the	thirty-five-and-under
crowd,	 and	 I	 suspect	 that	 the	 thirty-six-to-fifty-year-olds	 are	 starting	 to	come
around,	because	it’s	a	newer,	shinier,	and	maybe	even	happier	place	than	their
tried-and-true	Facebook.	Moreover,	the	importance	of	the	platform	doubled	with
the	launch	of	Instagram	Stories	in	August	2016.
Until	then,	Instagram	was	a	highly	curated	place.	That’s	one	of	the	reasons
people	love	it	so	much.	Less	polarized	and	politicized	than	Facebook,	it’s	a	place
where	you	go	to	post	the	beautiful	highlights	of	your	days.	That	was	a	bit	of	a
problem.	In	fact,	on	the	day	Stories	launched,	CEO	Kevin	Systrom	admitted	to
TechCrunch	that	he	hadn’t	posted	anything	to	Instagram	in	the	six	days	before
the	 interview	 because	 “none	 of	 the	 moments	 seemed	 special	enough.”
1

Meanwhile,	 the	 success	 of	 Snapchat	 Stories	 had	 proven	 that	 people	 were
extremely	interested	in	sharing	the	raw	footage	of	their	 lives	 so	 long	 as	 they
knew	 it	 wouldn’t	 stick	 around	 to	 haunt	 them	 forever.	 So	 Instagram	 copied
Stories	and	became	a	platform	that	gave	users	complete	freedom	to	create	as	the
mood	moved	them.	They	could	put	up	a	beautifully	filtered	photo	and	leave	it	up
like	a	fine	work	of	art	or	put	up	a	piece	of	throwaway	content	that	would	be
scrapped	like	the	first	draft	of	your	last	sales	presentation.
It	scaled	fast.	Snapchat	had	already	laid	all	the	groundwork	in	getting	people
comfortable	with	the	idea	of	ephemeral	content,	so	there	was	no	learning	curve
to	 contend	 with,	 as	 is	 the	 usual	 case	 when	 platforms	 introduce	 new	 features.
Instagram	placed	it	at	the	top	of	the	app,	too,	making	it	impossible	for	users	to
miss.	 In	 less	 than	 a	 year,	 Instagram	 Stories	 became	 one	 of	the	 most	 popular
features	of	one	of	the	biggest	platforms	in	the	world,	offering	a	dynamic	place
for	users	to	create	content	to	complement	their	perfectly	curated	Instagram	feed.
There	are	many	features	that	make	Instagram	a	requirement	for	any	budding
influencer	or	entrepreneur.	You	can	post	for	posterity,	or	you	can	post	for	instant
gratification.	You	can	draw	and	filter	and	caption	and	tag.	Though	the	feature	is
currently	available	only	to	verified	accounts,	you’ll	soon	be	able	to	add	links	to
your	posts,	a	simple	move	that	will	open	the	floodgate	of	opportunities	to	drive
people	to	your	other	content,	whether	it’s	on	your	website,	your	blog,	or	other
social	networks.
Anyone	wishing	to	build	a	personal	brand	should	be	on	Instagram.	Create	a
profile	now,	or	regret	it	for	years	to	come.
7	Steps	to	Biz	Dev
1.	Make	sure	your	Instagram	is	full	of	incredible	content,	the	best	you	can
make.	More	people	are	about	to	come	see	what	you’re	about.
2.	Search	relevant	keywords.	For	example,	if	you’re	building	a	biker	brand,
motorcycles.
3.	Click	on	the	first	hashtag	that	shows	up.	As	I	write	this,	there	are	over
2.4	million	posts	with	#motorcycles.
4.	Click	on	every	picture	you	see	with	that	hashtag.	The	first	four	that
show	up	in	this	instance	belong	to	accounts	that	have	a	combined
following	of	over	one	million	Instagrammers.
5.	Investigate	every	account	and	any	linked	websites	to	confirm	that	they

are	owned	by	people	or	companies	in	your	field,	or	even	if	they’re	not,
to	check	if	they	could	use	your	services	or	products	anyway.
6.	Click	on	the	three	dots	in	the	upper	right	corner	of	their	pages	and	send
those	individuals	or	businesses	a	custom-written	direct	message.	Do	not
spam	with	cut-and-paste	bullshit.	If	that’s	the	best	you	can	do,	you’ve
already	lost.
7.	In	your	message,	explain	what	drew	you	to	them	(I	love	your	work;	I’ve
always	admired	you;	you	post	the	funniest	memes;	this	post	is	so
creative;	etc.),	why	you	are	worth	paying	attention	to	(my	goal	is	to
promote	better	biker	safety;	I’ve	designed	a	helmet	even	the	most
helmet-averse	rider	won’t	mind	wearing;	I’ve	launched	the	freshest,
most	exciting	biker-themed	YouTube	channel	on	the	Internet),	and	what
value	you	can	offer	(I’d	like	to	send	you	one	of	my	helmets	to	try;	I’d

Do	this—search,	click,	investigate,	DM—for	six	to	seven	hours	every	day.	Do
it	during	every	lunch	break,	every	bathroom	break,	every	time	you’re	waiting	for

people	and	businesses	start	reaching	out	to.

Imagine	This
Let’s	say	your	name	is	Rick,	and	you’re	a	twenty-seven-year-old	clothing	store
manager	in	Nashville,	Tennessee.	You’re	ambitious,	and	you’re	lucky	enough	to

work	 for	 an	 organization	 that	 isn’t	 interested	 in	 micromanaging	 your	 social-
media	accounts.*	You	start	taking	pictures	of	everything	in	the	store—let’s	call	it
EnAvant—and	everyone	who	walks	in,	if	they	will	let	you.	You	photograph	the
tops	as	they’re	being	laid	out	on	the	shelves,	the	dresses	as	they’re	being	hung,
the	 shoes	 as	 they’re	being	 displayed.	 You	 photograph	 yourself	 in	 the	 men’s
fashions,	adding	your	personal	flair	to	every	outfit,	and	you	photograph	your
female	employees	in	the	women’s	clothing.	You	ask	your	customers	if	they’ll
pose	 for	 pictures	 in	 their	 new	 outfits.	 Then	you	 post	 every	 picture	 on	 your
Instagram	 account,	 accompanied	 by	 well-thought-out,	 relevant	 hashtags.	 You
know	that	how	you	frame	your	images,	or	the	techniques	you	use	to	give	them	a
sense	 of	 fun	 or	 creativity	 and	 really	 show	 off	 the	 clothes,	 will	be	 crucial	 to
growing	your	fan	base.	But	you	can’t	build	a	fan	base	if	you’re	not	visible.	Aside
from	getting	influencers	to	mention	you	or	your	product,	or	paying	for	ads,	you
know	that	the	fastest	way	for	a	brand	starting	at	zero,	like	yours,	is	to	master
hashtags.	If	it’s	springtime,	and	you’re	posting	a	picture	of	a	woman	in	a	canary-
yellow	raincoat,	you	include	the	coat	brand’s	hashtag,	along	with	#EnAvantwear,
#springfashion,	#springlooks,	#raincoat,	#readyforrain,	#yellow.	As	more	people
spot	your	work,	in	time	you	become	known	for	your	fashion	sense	and	cheeky
sense	of	humor.
You	start	reaching	out	to	people	who	live	in	the	vicinity	of	the	store,	but	you
don’t	use	direct	mail,	because	who’s	got	money	for	that?	And	you	don’t	hunt	for
the	fashionistas	and	society	people	already	appearing	in	the	local	culture-and-
lifestyle	glossies	 that	 document	 all	 the	 area	 fund-raisers	 and	 real	 estate
development.	 Instead,	 every	 day	 during	 your	 lunch	 break,	you	 open	 up	 your
Instagram	account	and	type	in	“Nashville,	Tennessee.”	Up	pop	the	most	popular
posts	in	the	area.	You	click	around	on	a	few	of	the	ones	with	the	most	followers
to	make	sure	they	live	in	or	around	Nashville,	and	in	particular,	you	look	for
pictures	in	these	accounts	that	suggest	the	account	owners	would	be	interested	in
wearing	pieces	from	your	store.	You	then	send	them	a	direct	message:	“Hi,	my
name	is	Rick	and	I’m	the	manager	of	EnAvant.	Love	your	look.	Come	by	the
store,	we’d	love	to	give	you	a	gift	certificate	for	20	percent	off.”
In	the	time	it	takes	you	to	finish	your	chicken	salad,	you’ve	started	building
relationships	with	six	new	people	who	live	near	your	store	and	have	a	proven
interest	in	your	product.	You	do	this	every	day,	five	days	a	week.	Of	the	thirty-
two	people	you	talk	to	every	week,	seven	post	a	story	about	how	this	guy	named
Rick	who	works	at	EnAvant	reached	out	to	compliment	their	shoes,	top,	or	hat,
and	offered	them	a	discount	at	the	store.
Maybe	you	go	even	further.	You	put	together	a	fashion	show	and	DM	all	the
influencers	in	the	area,	as	well	as	any	locals	whose	Instagram	account	makes	it

clear	they’re	really	into	clothes	and	accessories,	and	invite	them	to	attend	so	they
can	see	the	new	collection	and	get	30	percent	off	all	in-store	purchases.	And	then
you	make	sure	the	event	is	so	fun	and	special	that	people	start	posting	pics	of
themselves	and	telling	their	followers	where	they’re	spending	their	evening.
Here’s	what	happens	next:
People	start	posting	pictures	of	themselves	on	their	own	Instagram	accounts
and	tagging	you,	the	brand,	and	the	store.	Competitors	start	reaching	out	to	find
out	 if	 you’re	 interested	 in	 re-creating	 some	 of	 your	 magic	 at	 their	 stores.
Meanwhile,	someone	in	EnAvant’s	upper	management	takes	notice	and	realizes
that	she	has	an	incredibly	valuable	employee	in	Tennessee	whom	she	will	do
pretty	much	anything	to	keep.
Or:
By	following	up	all	this	incredible	word	of	mouth	with	impeccable	customer
service	for	those	who	venture	into	the	store,	in	short	order	EnAvant	becomes	one
of	the	hottest	new	stores	in	Nashville—and	you	catch	the	attention	of	fashion
photographers	and	clothing	designers	all	over	the	country.
Or:
Some	of	the	brands	you	feature	in	your	Instagram	posts	notice	what	you’ve
done	and	reach	out	to	find	out	if	you’re	interested	in	helping	them	with	their
social	media.	That’s	another	big	win.
Or:
You	 have	 so	 much	 fun	 sharing	 your	 brand	 of	 visual	 storytelling	 that	 you
decide	 you	 want	 to	 do	 it	 full-time,	 and	 you	 launch	your	 own	 digital	 fashion
magazine.
Not	only	can	you	build	business	for	the	store	by	biz-deving	this	way,	but	also
you	can	make	someone’s	day.	Any	or	all	of	these	scenarios	could	happen,	and
they	could	happen	to	you,	whether	you’re	a	clothing	store	manager	or	work	in
retail	of	any	kind,	even	in	a	restaurant.	It	all	comes	down	to	passion	and	proper
execution.
How	I’m	Crushing	It
Brittany	Xavier,	Thrifts	and	Threads
IG:	@thriftsandthreads
It	 was	 supposed	 to	 be	 just	 a	 hobby,	 a	 creative	 outlet	 to

practice	with	her	new	camera.	That’s	what	Brittany	Xavier	had
in	mind	 when	 she	 launched	 her	 blog,	 Thrifts	 and	 Threads,	 in
December	2013.	Even	as	a	political	science	major,	she’d	always
loved	fashion	 and	 had	 made	 it	 a	 habit	 to	 follow	 trends	 and
designers.	Her	look	was	a	blend	of	high	and	low	fashion,	mixing
ready-to-wear	with	 vintage	 finds	 and	 select	 designer	 pieces.
Upon	graduation,	she	was	accepted	by	several	law	schools,	but,
concerned	 that	law	 school	 was	 incompatible	 with	 raising	 a
toddler—her	 daughter,	 Jadyn,	 was	 only	 three	 years	 old—she
instead	 went	 to	 work	for	 an	 insurance	 marketer	 that	 would
guarantee	family-friendly	hours.	It	paid	the	bills,	and	it	wasn’t
too	demanding.	She	often	found	herself	finished	with	her	goals
for	the	day	by	four	p.m.	and	had	to	find	busywork	to	fill	up	the
time	until	she	could	go	home	at	six.
Even	when	they	were	dating,	she	and	her	husband,	Anthony,
also	in	marketing,	had	always	had	side	hustles,	such	as	buying
items	at	discount	stores	and	reselling	them	on	Amazon.	It	was
something	they	did	as	a	couple,	a	shared	activity	that	gave	them
a	little	 sense	 of	 freedom.	 In	 addition,	 Anthony,	 who	 had
developed	an	interest	in	Web	design	and	social	media	in	college,
built	websites.	 When	 he	 got	 a	 camera	 soon	 after	 they	 were
married,	 they	 thought	 they’d	 go	 out	 and	 take	 pictures	 of
themselves	and	their	daughter,	document	their	family	life	on	a
blog,	and	hopefully	make	a	little	money	off	the	affiliate	links.
Xavier,	 always	interested	 in	 style	 and	 fashion,	 would	 do	 the
creative,	and	Anthony	would	take	care	of	the	back	end	of	the
blog.
The	only	reason	Xavier	started	an	Instagram	account	was	to
promote	and	bring	traffic	to	the	blog.	She	figured	out	that	she
was	supposed	to	tag	brands	and	use	hashtags	by	looking	at	other
accounts	like	hers.	Six	months	in,	when	she’d	accrued	about	ten
thousand	followers	and	was	earning	about	$100	per	month	from
the	affiliate	links	on	her	blog,	she	started	getting	occasional	calls
from	brands	asking	if	they	could	send	her	some	clothes	so	she
could	post	photos	of	herself	wearing	some	of	their	pieces.	That’s
when	she	started	doing	some	research	and	discovered	that	there
was	a	whole	strategy	behind	growing	an	Instagram	account.	She
and	 Anthony	 stayed	 up	 late	 at	 night	 reading	 and	 listening	 to
podcasts	about	online	marketing.	It	was	after	reading	Crush	It!

that	they	realized	the	blog	could	be	more	than	just	a	fun	hobby
—an	actual	business.
That’s	 when	 she	 started	 charging	 brands	 for	 posts.	 At	 first,
one	Instagram	post	with	the	brand	mentioned	in	the	caption	was
$100.	If	the	brand	simply	wanted	to	be	tagged,	she’d	charge	$50.
When	 the	 people	 on	 the	 other	 end	 of	 the	 phone	 expressed
surprise,	“Oh,	 only	 $100?”	 she	 knew	 she	 was	 underselling
herself,	so	she	upped	her	fee	to	$200	per	post.	Then	one	day,	an
established	jewelry	line	e-mailed	her	and	proposed	one	blog	post
and	one	Instagram	post	for	a	fee	of	$1,000.
Xavier	wasn’t	a	seasoned	influencer	yet,	but	she	was	smart
enough	to	know	that	a	company’s	first	offer	was	almost	always
less	than	what	it	was	ultimately	willing	to	pay.
Again	she	raised	her	rates,	and	soon	she	was	earning	as	much
or	more	per	day	as	she	was	at	her	insurance	marketing	job.	After
three	 months	 of	 matching	 her	 income,	 a	 year-and-a-half	 after
starting	the	blog,	she	left	her	day	job	so	she	could	network	and
accept	more	invitations	for	brand	meetings	and	to	preview	new
collections.	There	she	also	met	other	bloggers	who	were	willing
to	 answer	 questions	 and	 help	 her	 calculate	 her	 worth.	 At	 her
husband’s	suggestion,	she	also	started	getting	more	personal	on
her	blog,	starting	with	a	post	titled	“I	Quit.”	The	response	was	so
overwhelming,	in	particular	from	other	people	wanting	advice
on	how	to	start	their	own	blogs,	that	she	started	posting	weekly
blogging	tips.	The	first,	“How	I	Started	My	Blog	in	5	Steps,”
remains	one	of	her	most	read	posts.
Today	 Xavier	 has	 a	 manager	 who	 negotiates	 her	 fees	 and
helps	 her	 get	 branding	 work,	 but	 she	 still	 tags	 brands	 she’s
wearing,	and	she	only	posts	brands	she	really	loves	and	believes
in.	The	blog	has	also	expanded	from	strictly	fashion	to	a	lifestyle
brand.	Xavier	travels	a	lot	for	work,	but	she	uses	the	opportunity
to	 produce	 travel	 content	 on	 the	 go,	 photographing	 herself	at
hotels,	resorts,	and	restaurants	that	she	likes	and	that	she	thinks
her	readers	will	appreciate.	For	this	reason,	she	has	developed
good	relationships	with	a	number	of	hotel	brands,	and	now	when
she	and	her	family	travel	on	their	own,	their	stays	are	usually
comped.	She	is	also	frequently	invited	to	visit	openings	of	new
resorts	 or	 hotels	 so	 she	 can	 share	 the	 experience	with	 her
readers.

In	May	2016,	Anthony	quit	his	job,	too,	a	move	he	announced
in	a	blog	titled	“He	Quit	Too.”	The	pair	tries	to	shoot	all	their
photos	 during	 the	 day	 so	 that	 they	 are	 available	 when	 their
daughter	comes	home	from	school.	Jadyn’s	life	changed	as	well.
Her	 father	 is	 present	 for	 every	 school	 event.	 She	 no	 longer
attends	after-school	care.	Sometimes	brands	request	pictures	of
Brittany	 with	 Jadyn,	 especially	 for	 child-friendly	 or	 Mother’s
Day	 events	 or	 promotions.	 When	 that	 happens,	 Xavier’s	 rate
goes	up,	and	she	deposits	a	portion	of	the	fee	into	an	account
created	for	Jadyn,	which	she’s	using	to	teach	her	ten-year-old	the
basic	principles	of	financial	literacy.
The	 multiple	 deadlines	 and	 the	 inability	 to	 turn	 off	 the
machine,	even	for	a	short	vacation,	can	create	a	lot	of	pressure.
“I’ve	been	doing	this	for	almost	four	years,	the	same	thing	every
day.	 We’re	 taking	 photos,	 we’re	 shooting	 content,	 writing,
thinking	about	future	trends.”	But	the	couple’s	daughter	helps
keep	everything	in	focus	for	them.
Having	a	child	means	that	Xavier	refuses	more	jobs	than	a	lot
of	other	lifestyle	bloggers.	It’s	not	always	an	easy	choice.
I	turned	down	a	really	great	job	from	a	well-known	jewelry	line.	They
wanted	 me	 to	 attend	 a	 two-hour	 dinner,	 and	 post	 to	 Instagram	and
Facebook	while	I	was	there.	The	job	was	more	than	a	three-month	salary
at	my	former	full-time	job.	As	far	as	posting	requirements,	this	was	one
of	the	easiest	jobs	I	probably	could	have	booked,	but	I	had	agreed	to	go
on	a	school	trip	to	Sacramento	with	Jadyn.	It	was	killing	me,	but	I	had	to
keep	it	in	focus.	The	whole	reason	I	did	this	was	so	I	could	go	on	these
trips	with	Jadyn	and	be	there	for	her.	There	will	be	other	jobs.
The	 competition	 in	 the	 fashion	 and	 lifestyle	 blogosphere	 is
fierce,	but	Xavier	still	sees	room	for	newcomers.	“Even	though
it	is	saturated,	if	you	can	do	it	in	a	unique	way	or	have	your	own
style,	 you	 can	 definitely	 stand	 out	 in	 the	 crowd.	 Brands	are
always	 looking	 for	 what’s	 new.	 They’re	 also	 pouring	 more
money	into	[influencer	marketing],	because	they’re	seeing	more
of	the	conversion	of	blogs	versus	a	radio	ad	or	a	television	ad,
where	they	have	no	tracking.	But	through	blogs,	they’re	able	to
track	exactly	where	the	links	are	coming	from	and	exactly	the
conversions.
“Brands	are	definitely	catching	on	more,	and	the	ones	that	are
not	using	affiliates	or	not	doing	the	campaigns	are	figuring	out

how	they	can	get	into	that.”	In	fact,	digital	ad	sales	are	expected
to	surpass	global	TV	ad	sales	by	the	end	of	2017.
2
On	screen	Xavier	and	her	family’s	life	seems	effortless,	but
she	expresses	surprise	at	how	many	people	don’t	recognize	how
much	 work	 it	 takes	 to	 build	 a	 successful	 blog	 and	 Instagram
account.
So	many	people	write	me	and	say,	“I	wrote	a	post	and	no	one	read	it.	So
how	would	I	grow	that?”	I’m	like,	“You	didn’t	even	do	any	consistent
work.”	I	worked	so	much	on	the	weekends	and	nights	while	working	my
other	job.	I	didn’t	go	out	with	my	friends.	I	didn’t	go	out	on	dates.	We
literally	stayed	at	home	and	worked	on	our	computer	after	our	daughter
went	to	bed.	It’s	a	lot	of	writing;	it’s	a	lot	of	research.	You	don’t	just	sign
up.	For	the	first	year,	I	wasn’t	making	any	money,	maybe	$100	or	$200	a
month.	It	was	nothing.	People	don’t	understand	that	part.	They’re	like,
“Why	would	you	do	it	for	a	year	when	you	see	no	return?”	I	was	seeing
a	return	on	my	readership,	and	my	following	was	growing,	and	that	was
motivating	me.	But	for	someone	starting	a	blog	who	wants	to	make	it
specifically	 for	 money,	 it’s	 a	 hard	 way	 to	 start,	 because	 you’re	 not
passionate	about	what	you’re	doing.	You	have	to	love	what	you	do.

Podcasts
Podcasts	are	a	godsend	for	two	reasons.
1.	Most	people	aren’t	comfortable	on	camera.	They	think	they	look	stupid.
They	worry	about	their	hair,	their	glasses,	or	their	makeup.	They	fuss
over	the	lighting.	None	of	it	matters,	but	it’s	enough	to	distract	them
from	concentrating	on	providing	the	best	experience	they	can	for	their
viewers.	Podcasts	are	far	less	intimidating.
2.	Podcasts	sell	time,	which	is	why	everyone,	including	people	who	rock
on	camera,	should	try	to	create	one.	In	this	hyperspeed	world,
multitasking	is	everything,	and	it’s	a	lot	easier	to	listen	to	a	podcast
while	you	check	your	e-mails	and	pay	your	bills	than	to	watch	a
video.	In	addition,	as	of	2014,	the	139	million	total	commuters	in	the
United	States	spent	29.6	billion	hours	traveling	to	and	from	their
workplaces.
1
	A	lot	of	that	commute	time	is	spent	in	cars	where	drivers
can’t	watch	videos	(for	now).	They	can,	however,	easily	listen	to
podcasts.	In	the	information	age,	podcasts	allow	us	to	efficiently	and
effectively	maximize	our	knowledge.
I’ve	had	a	podcast	since	October	2014,	right	around	the	time	that	the	podcast
Serial,	produced	by	NPR’s	This	American	Life,	became	a	sensation	and	thrust
podcasting	 into	 the	 mainstream.	 But	 the	 truth	 is,	 I	 wasn’t	 following	 my	 own
advice.	 At	 the	time,	 I	 felt	 stretched	 too	 thin	 to	 produce	 yet	 another	 piece	 of
original	native	content	for	a	platform	(yes,	even	I	reach	my	limits	sometimes),	so

all	I	did	was	put	up	the	audio	track	from	the	AskGaryVee	show.	It	didn’t	do
badly—I	 was	 always	 in	the	 Top	 25	 podcasts	 in	 the	 business	 category—but	 I
knew	with	more	attention	it	could	do	better.	In	December	2016,	I	finally	figured
out	how	to	rebrand	it	as	The	GaryVee	Audio	Experience,	which	was	liberating.
Instead	of	exclusively	posting	AskGaryVee	content,	now	I	could	post	a	rant	I’d
recorded	into	my	phone	while	boarding	a	plane,	a	clip	from	one	of	my	keynotes,
or	 an	excerpt	 that	 didn’t	 make	 it	 into	 the	 DailyVee.	Inserting	 variety	 and
creativity	 helped	 the	 podcast’s	 popularity	 surge.	 Today	 my	 podcast	 sits
comfortably	 and	 consistently	in	 the	 list	 of	 the	 Top	 150	 podcasts	 on	 Apple’s
Charts.	 Some	 of	 those	 who	 listen	 are	 brand-new	 to	 my	 content,	 and	 others
already	follow	me	on	other	channels.	Either	way,	it	gives	me	one	more	way	to
share	my	content,	build	my	influence,	and	help	people	get	started	building	the
life	they	want.
Podcasts	101
Whether	you’re	uploading	onto	Spotify,	Apple	Podcasts,	SoundCloud,	Stitcher,
or	any	other	podcast	distribution	platform,	there	will	be	very	little	you	can	do	to
differentiate	one	from	another.	You	can	run	ads	on	Spotify	and	SoundCloud,	but
they’re	still	extremely	expensive.	Other	than	that,	as	of	this	writing,	there	are
really	no	original,	creative	ways	to	build	a	personal	brand	within	the	podcast
platforms	 other	 than	 by	 producing	 the	 best	 content	 you	 can.	 You’ll	 have	 to
promote	 your	 show	 through	your	 other	 social-media	 channels	 and	 encourage
symbiotic	relationships	with	others	who	have	bigger	platforms	than	you.
The	good	news,	however,	is	that	iTunes	will	open	podcasting	analytics,	so
podcasters	 will	 be	 able	 to	 see	 exactly	 where	 people	pause,	 skip,	 or	 sign	 off
within	their	content.	This	will	be	invaluable	in	helping	you	learn	faster	how	you
can	better	tailor	your	content	to	serve	your	audience	what	it	wants.
Imagine	This
Let’s	 say	 you’re	 a	 seventy-five-year-old	 woman	 named	 Blanche.	 Your	 best
friend	is	Judy.	You’ve	been	inseparable	since	you	were	young	girls	growing	up
on	the	same	block,	and	you’ve	never	lived	more	than	a	few	miles	apart.	The	two
of	you	have	raised	a	combined	total	of	six	children,	been	married	three	times,
buried	one	husband,	taken	twelve	joint	vacations,	adopted	eleven	pets,	and	over

the	past	ten	years,	the	only	time	you’ve	missed	your	monthly	standing	date	for	a
movie	and	lunch	at	Ruby	Tuesday	was	that	time	when	Judy	was	hospitalized
with	gallstones.
One	night,	in	line	to	buy	candy	before	seeing	Wonder	Woman	at	the	movie
theater,	Judy	says	she	thought	Kathleen	Turner’s	best	performance	might	have
been	when	she	did	the	speaking	voice	of	Jessica	Rabbit.	Here	we	go	again.	One
of	the	reasons	you	like	going	to	the	movies	with	Judy	is	that	you	two	rarely
agree	on	the	merits	of	a	film,	and	it	makes	for	great	debate	over	burgers	and	fries
afterward.	But	this	time	she’s	taken	you	by	surprise.	You	raise	your	eyebrows	so
high	they	climb	right	over	your	hairline.	Better	than	Turner’s	role	in	Romancing
the	Stone?	Better	than	Prizzi’s	Honor?	Better	than	Peggy	Sue	Got	Married?	Judy
holds	firm.	As	you	bicker,	you	can	hear	people	chuckling	behind	you.	Someone
says,	“They’re	the	new	Siskel	and	Ebert.”
That	 gives	 you	 an	 idea.	 After	 the	 movie,	 you	 and	 Judy	 head	 over	 to	 your
favorite	quiet	corner	at	the	local	RT,	but	before	the	two	of	you	exchange	your
thoughts	 about	Wonder	Woman,	 you	 pull	 out	 your	 iPhone	 and	 hit	 the	 voice
memo	button.	You	record	your	conversation.	You	go	home,	and	the	next	day	you
call	your	nephew,	who	has	a	podcast	about	muscle	cars,	and	ask	him	how	to
upload	your	“tape”	onto	the	Internet.	He	gently	informs	you	that	you’re	going	to
need	to	upload	the	MP3	file	onto	a	podcasting	platform,	and	that	if	you	can	wait
until	the	weekend	he’d	be	happy	to	show	you	a	few	simple	steps	and	teach	you
to	use	the	basic	equipment	you’ll	need	to	get	set	up.	If	you	can’t	wait,	he	says,
you	can	find	all	the	information	you	need	on	the	Internet.	“Just	Google	how	to
upload	a	podcast	and	distribute	it.”	You	decide	to	wait,	but	in	the	meantime,	you
call	Judy	and	tell	her	that	you	want	to	go	to	the	movies	again	next	week.
Thus	begins	the	Blanche	and	Judy	Show,	a	movie	review	podcast	in	which
two	 elderly	 ladies	 share	 their	 thoughts	 on	 movies	 past	and	 present.	 Your
personalities,	deep	friendship,	and	chemistry	make	it	a	riot	for	listeners,	but	you
also	make	it	uniquely	2018	by	recording	your	conversations	in	the	theater	before
the	movie	starts,	on	such	topics	as	your	strong	conviction	that	Raisinettes	are	a
disgrace	to	the	grape	and	Judy’s	memories	about	the	ushers	that	used	to	escort
ladies	to	their	seats.	You	also	interview	four	people	as	they	walk	out	of	the	film
to	get	their	take.
In	 three	 short	 years,	 yours	 is	 one	 of	 the	 Top	 150	 podcasts	 on	 Apple.	 The
podcast	is	your	pillar,	but	you	use	it	to	create	microcontent,	too.	Judy’s	sense	of
humor	 is	 often	 good	 for	 a	 quote,	 so	 you	 create	 memes	 and	 post	 them	 on
Facebook	 and	 Instagram.	You	 engage	 with	 people	 on	 Twitter	 and	 raise
awareness	 of	 the	 podcast	 there.	 The	 two	 of	 you	 are	 interviewed	 by
Entertainment	Weekly	and	Variety.	In	time,	it	gets	harder	for	you	to	get	out	of	the

house	every	week—your	back	often	aches,	and	you’re	most	comfortable	in	your
La-Z-Boy—but	it	doesn’t	matter	anymore	because	the	studios	are	sending	you
and	Judy	their	movies	to	preview.	Thanks	to	the	branding	opportunities	that	have
come	your	way,	all	of	your	living	expenses	are	more	than	easily	covered,	and
you	are	thrilled	to	know	that	you	will	be	able	to	pass	much	more	of	the	savings
you	and	your	husband	accrued	over	a	lifetime	to	your	family.
How	I’m	Crushing	It
John	Lee	Dumas,	Entrepreneurs	on	Fire
IG:	@johnleedumas
“I	was	dying	a	slow	death	in	the	cubicle.”
Sound	familiar?
If	 you’re	 still	 young	 or	 in	 school,	 is	 it	 something	 you	 are
trying	like	hell	to	avoid?
“I	had	this	whole	world	of	creativity	inside	of	me,	but	I	wasn’t
able	to	use	any	of	it.	I	felt	like	I	was	almost	choking	on	my	own
creativity	because	I	had	to	be	in	a	suit	and	tie	and	very	formal.
Everything	was	black	and	white,	and	I	needed	some	color	in	my
life.”
Until	he	turned	thirty-two,	John	Lee	Dumas’s	life	had	been	as
traditional	as	apple	pie.	The	grandson	of	two	military	veterans
and	the	son	of	a	JAG	officer,	service	to	his	country	was	in	his
blood.	 He	 left	 his	 small	 town	 in	 Maine	 in	 1998	 on	 an	 Army
ROTC	scholarship	to	major	in	American	Studies	at	Providence
College	in	Rhode	Island.	A	member	of	the	first	round	of	officers
commissioned	 after	 9/11,	 a	 year	 to	 the	 day	 after	 graduating
college,	 he	 started	 a	 thirteen-month	 tour	 of	 duty	 in	 Iraq.	 He
spent	four	years	on	active	duty	before	returning	to	the	civilian
world.	He	was	at	the	start	of	a	four-year	stint	as	a	captain	in	the
reserves,	but	otherwise	he	had	no	idea	what	to	do	with	himself.
He	tried	law	school	but	dropped	out	six	months	later.	He	then
worked	in	corporate	finance	for	a	few	years,	but	when	he’d	look
at	the	people	working	in	the	positions	above	him,	he	knew	he
didn’t	want	their	jobs.	He	had	a	feeling	that	he	was	destined	for

entrepreneurship,	but	he	didn’t	know	what	it	really	entailed	or
how	to	even	begin.	So	he	started	reading	self-help	and	business
books.	In	2009,	one	month	after	its	publication,	he	read	Crush
It!	That	was	the	book	that	inspired	him	to	quit	the	finance	job,
move	to	San	Diego	(where	he’d	never	been),	and	become	a	real
estate	agent.
He	kept	at	it	for	three	years,	but	the	job	still	didn’t	feel	like	a
perfect	fit.	He	kept	rereading	Crush	It!	every	year,	though,	and
in	2012,	something	new	struck	him.	I	emphasized	that,	no	matter
what	industry	you	worked	in,	you	had	to	build	a	personal	brand.
He	realized	that	he	wasn’t	doing	that	at	all.	He	had	a	personal
Facebook	page,	but	he	wasn’t	even	on	LinkedIn	or	Twitter	in
any	 professional	 capacity.	 So	 he	 knew	 that	 needed	 to	 change
right	away.
The	 other	 thing	 that	 caught	 his	 attention	 was	 the	 idea	 of
podcasting.	 He	 wasn’t	 really	 sure	 what	 a	 podcast	 was,	 so	 he
decided	to	 research	 it.	 He	 discovered	 that	 they	 were	 free	 and
offered	focused,	targeted	content.	All	those	self-help	books	and
audiobooks	were	getting	expensive,	and	now	he	had	to	listen	to
even	more	if	he	was	going	to	build	a	personal	brand.	Podcasts
sounded	like	they	were	right	up	his	alley.
“And	that’s	when	I	fell	in	love	with	the	medium.	I	became	a
super-consumer.	 For	 eight	 months,	 I	 listened	 to	 as	 many
podcasts	as	I	could.	And	it	struck	me	that,	jeez,	I’m	driving	to
work	every	single	day,	I’m	hitting	the	gym	multiple	times	per
week—I	need	 to	 find	 that	 seven-day-a-week	 show	 that
interviews	an	entrepreneur	and	talks	about	their	failures,	lessons
learned,	aha	moments.	So	I	went	to	iTunes	to	find	that	show.	It
didn’t	exist!	And	I	thought,	I	can’t	believe	this.	Why	not	be	the
person	to	create	that	show?”
So	what	if	he	had	no	experience	in	production	or	interviewing
people?	 “I	 thought,	Well,	if	I	do	a	daily	show,	I’ll	get	better
quicker.	Because	all	these	people,	they’re	doing	four	episodes	a
month	 with	 their	 weekly	 shows.	 I’m	 going	 to	 be	 doing	 thirty
episodes	a	month.	I	just	need	to	step	into	this	void	and	do	it,	and
I’m	going	to	be	bad.	I’m	going	to	do	a	hack	job	for	a	decent
amount	of	time.	And	you	can	listen	to	today’s	podcast	and	go
back	 to	 episode	 15,	 and	 you	 can	 see,	 this	 guy	 isn’t	 the	 same
person.	I	 was	 so	 bad.	 I	 was	 nervous,	 I	 was	 naïve.	 I	 was	 just

hacking	 my	 way	 through	 it.	 But	 I	 kept	 doing	 it	 every	 single
day.”
He	 didn’t	 just	 turn	 on	 a	 mic	 and	 start	 talking.	 Instead,	 he
researched,	diving	into	YouTube,	absorbing	all	the	free	content
and	 advice	 made	 available	 by	 other	 podcasters,	 and	 he	 found
two	mentors.	Unnervingly,	both	strongly	advised	against	doing	a
daily	 show,	 explaining	 that	 they	 made	 all	 their	 money	 doing
other	things	beside	podcasting.	A	daily	show	would	preclude	all
those	 other	 activities.	 It	 was	 the	 only	 piece	 of	 advice	 Dumas
rejected.
“I	was	like,	‘You	don’t	understand.	I’m	so	bad	that	if	I	did	do
what	everybody	else	is	doing,	nobody’s	going	to	listen.	It’s	just
not	going	to	be	good.	So	I	have	to	do	something	different.	I	have
to	 be	 unique.	 I	 have	 to	 do	 something	 that’s	 going	 to	raise
people’s	eyebrows.’”
Those	two	mentors,	with	their	large	virtual	Rolodexes,	were
invaluable	 to	 helping	 Dumas	 land	 his	 first	 interviews.	 They
weren’t	going	 to	 introduce	 him	 to	 A	 players,	 but	 they	 were
willing	to	introduce	him	to	the	B,	C,	and	D	players	who	were
still	building	an	audience,	publishing	books,	and	eager	to	share
their	 stories	 with	 a	 neophyte	 in	 exchange	 for	 additional
exposure.
It	might	sound	as	though	Dumas	has	more	confidence	than	the
average	human.	Yet	despite	his	conviction	that	podcasting	every
day—learning	 by	 doing—would	 be	 the	 best	 way	 to	 create	 a
quality	product,	and	despite	many	of	his	early	guests’	relatively
low	 profiles	 and	 the	 public’s	 almost	 immediate	 positive
response,	 Dumas	 found	 himself	 almost	 paralyzed	 by	 imposter
syndrome.	Who	was	he	to	reach	out	to	anyone	for	a	one-on-one
conversation?	 But	 he	 soldiered	 on	 and	 worked	 through	 his
doubts	and	fears.
I	 started	 my	 entrepreneurial	 journey	 with	 one	 strength,	 and	 that	 was
discipline,	and	 I	 can	 tie	 that	 directly	 back	 to	 the	 army.	But	discipline
alone	is	not	going	to	get	you	anywhere.	The	two	biggest	areas	I	had	to
develop	to	go	along	with	discipline	were	productivity	and	focus.	People
who	are	“just	disciplined”	can	do	something	all	day	long,	but	what	if
they’re	producing	the	wrong	content?	That’s	where	productivity	has	to
come	in.	And	you’re	not	going	to	be	able	to	consistently	produce	the
right	content	unless	you’re	able	to	block	out	what	I	call	the	weapons	of
mass	distraction.

He	launched	his	podcast,	Entrepreneurs	on	Fire,	in	September
2012.	 As	 his	 guests	 shared	 their	 interviews	 with	 their	 sizable
audiences,	the	podcast	started	ranking	on	the	iTunes	New	and
Noteworthy	list.	The	dual	effect	meant	that	within	two-and-a-
half	months	the	podcast	drew	over	a	hundred	thousand	unique
downloads.	 He	 started	 receiving	 invitations	 to	 conferences,
which	gave	him	greater	credibility	and,	along	with	his	rapidly
growing	numbers,	the	opening	to	approach	bigger	names,	such
as	Seth	Godin	and	Tim	Ferriss,	who	had	both	just	released	new
books,	Barbara	Corcoran,	and	yes,	Gary	Vaynerchuk.
Now	he	was	ready	to	explore	ways	to	monetize.	He	turned	to
his	audience	and	asked	them	what	they	wanted,	and	he	listened.
What	I	found	very	clearly	was,	if	you	are	willing	to	commit	to	delivering
free,	valuable,	and	consistent	content,	you	are	going	to	build	an	audience
from	that.	Then,	if	you	are	willing	to	engage	that	audience	one-on-one
and	ask	them,	“What	are	you	struggling	with?”	and	then	just	listen,	they
will	tell	you	what	their	pain	points	are,	their	obstacles,	their	challenges,
their	struggles.	And	then	you,	the	person	that	they	know,	like,	and	trust,
who’s	been	delivering	that	free,	valuable,	and	consistent	content	for	a
significant	 amount	 of	 time,	 can	 provide	 the	 solution	 in	 the	 form	 of	 a
product,	or	a	service,	or	a	community.
And	 he	 did.	 Like	 Pat	 Flynn,	 each	 month	 he	 publishes	 a
breakdown	of	what	the	business	earns	from	his	various	revenue
streams,	which	all	add	up	to	anywhere	from	around	$200K	to
$300K	per	month.	He	also	analyzes	the	company’s	successes,	so
other	 people	can	 emulate	 them,	 and	 all	 the	 mistakes	 they’ve
made,	including	money	lost,	so	people	can	avoid	making	them.
Despite	 being	 a	 millionaire	 several	 times	 over,	 Dumas	 still
reads	Crush	It!	every	year.
The	thing	that	keeps	coming	back	to	me	is	the	landgrab.	That’s	what	I
think	so	many	people	miss.	All	the	time,	people	say,	“John,	you’re	so
lucky	that	you	started	podcasting	when	it	was	nothing	and	now	it’s	the
golden	 age	 of	 podcasting.	 You	 had	the	 landgrab.”	 And	 they’re
completely	right.	My	timing	was	perfect.	It	was	super	amounts	of	luck
and	 great	 timing,	 but	 what	they	 miss	 is	 that	 there’s	 always	 that	 next
thing.	They’re	not	focusing	on	the	next	thing;	they’re	looking	at	the	past
and	there’s	the	next	Snapchat,	then	there’s	Instagram	Stories,	now	there’s
Facebook	Live.	There’s	always	that	next	opportunity	to	landgrab	and	to
become	that	person.	Yes,	I’m	considered	the	“king	of	podcasting”	in	a	lot
of	niches	because	I’ve	been	able	to	build	a	seven-figure	business	around
just	 podcasting.	 But	 since	 I’ve	 launched	 my	 podcast,	 there	 have	 been
people	 that	 have	become	 the	 king	 of	 Periscope,	 and	 then	 the	 king	 of

Snapchat,	and	the	king	of	Instagram.	Things	that	didn’t	even	exist	when
I	 launched	 my	 podcast.	 And	 while	 people	 were	 saying,	 “John,	 I	 just
missed	 the	 boat	 with	 podcasting,”	 I’m	 like,	 “Yeah,	 but	you’ve	 also
missed	 the	 boat	 with	 all	 these	 other	 things.”	 So	 what	 I	 learned	 from
Crush	It!	and	continues	to	be	relevant	to	me	is,	always	keep	your	eyes	on
that	horizon.

Voice-First
This	may	be	my	favorite	chapter.	Chances	are	good	that	most	people	reading
have	 at	 least	 heard	 of,	 if	 not	 experimented	 with,	all	 the	 platforms	 we	 have
discussed	 so	 far	 in	 this	 book.	 But	 few	 of	 you	 at	 the	 time	 of	 this	 writing	 are
probably	sitting	around	thinking,	What’s	my	Alexa	Skill	gonna	be?	And	yet	you
should,	because	we’re	about	to	talk	about	a	tech	innovation	that	I	am	absolutely
sure	will	transform	how	the	world	consumes	content.	It’s	called	Voice-First,	and
anyone	currently	building	a	personal	brand	needs	to	learn	about	it	fast	and	early.
Its	 platforms	 are	 the	 equivalent	 of	 yet-to-be-discovered	 Malibu	 beachfront
property,	much	like	Twitter	in	2006,	Instagram	in	2010,	and	Snapchat	in	2012.
I	day-trade	attention,	and	lately	I	am	particularly	interested	by	what	people
pay	attention	to	during	the	transitions	of	their	day,	especially	the	three	that	occur
in	the	home:	what	they	do	during	the	first	fifteen	minutes	of	their	morning,	the
first	fifteen	 minutes	 after	 they	 come	 home	 from	 work,	 and	 the	 last	 fifteen
minutes	before	they	go	to	sleep	at	night.	Those	are	transition	periods.	They’re
the	moments	when	we	take	stock,	get	updated,	and	plan	for	the	next	few	hours	of
our	lives.	We’re	busy,	so	we	want	to	do	it	fast.	There	was	a	time	you’d	pull	out	a
pen	and	paper	and	start	a	to-do	list,	turn	on	the	radio,	or	even	check	an	app.	Now,
though,	you	don’t	even	have	to	do	that.	All	you	have	to	do	is	talk.
Podcasts	 fill	 our	 brains	 during	 the	 long	 periods	 when	 we’re	 quiet,	 such	 as
while	we	drive	or	travel.	Voice-first	platforms	are	going	to	allow	us	to	fill	our
brains	during	all	the	interstices	of	our	lives,	those	blips	of	time	that	used	to	be
lost	to	forgettable	activities	like	brushing	our	teeth,	sorting	through	mail,	or	even
checking	our	phone	notifications.	In	2016,	Google	revealed	that	20	percent	of

searches	on	its	mobile	app	and	Android	devices	are	done	by	voice.
1
	That	number
is	only	going	to	rise,	fast.	And	you	have	an	amazing	opportunity	to	make	sure
your	brand	rises	with	this	trend.
As	of	this	moment,	there	are	two	key	players:	Amazon	Alexa,	played	through
a	device	called	the	Echo,	and	Google	Assistant,	played	through	its	Google	Home
device.	 Microsoft,	 Apple,	 Samsung,	 and	 others	 are	 preparing	 to	 make	 their
respective	pushes	into	the	space	with	platforms	of	their	own,	but	at	this	time	it
makes	sense	to	focus	only	on	the	big	two.	I	started	with	Alexa,	launching	a	Flash
Briefing	 Skill	 called	 GaryVee365.	 A	 Flash	 Briefing	 is	 a	 short	 report	 offering
users	a	key	bit	of	information.	Mine	offers	daily	motivation	from	yours	truly.
The	Skimm’s	airs	its	breakdown	of	the	day’s	top	news	stories;	eHow’s	presents
daily	life	hacks.	Add	these	and	others	to	your	list	of	Flash	Briefings,	and	when
you	ask	for	them,	either	by	saying,	“Alexa,	give	me	my	Flash	Briefings,”	 or
even,	“Alexa,	what’s	in	the	news?”	you’ll	hear	from	your	favorite	sources	one
after	another.
Other	 Skills	 offer	 more	 interactive	 experiences.	 Enable	The	 Tonight	 Show
Skill	(as	opposed	to	the	Flash	Briefing)	and	you	could	ask	for	Jimmy	Fallon’s
most	recent	monologue,	but	you	could	also	get	the	most	recent	Tonight	Show
guest	list	or	a	rundown	of	his	newest	Thank-You	Notes,	a	popular	segment	on
the	 show	 where	 he	 expresses	 gratitude	 for	 anything	from	 Pop-Tarts	 to	 Ryan
Gosling.	 I	 could	 develop	 a	 Skill	 called	 GaryVee	 Recommends	 Wine	 that
recommends	three	wines	to	go	with	whatever	you	told	it	you	were	going	to	eat
and	gives	you	the	ability	to	order	those	wines	straight	from	the	Skill	through	a
third-party	alcohol	delivery	service	like	Drizly	or	Minibar	Delivery	or	from	my
family	wine	shop,	Wine	Library.
What	we’re	seeing	with	the	development	of	Voice-First	is	the	culmination	of
our	addiction	to	speed.	The	world	moves	fast	and	we	want	to	keep	up.	If	there	is
a	choice	between	reading	a	notification	or	checking	an	app	and	getting	the	same
information	via	 Voice-First,	 which	 allows	 us	 to	 keep	 our	 hands	 free	 and
multitask,	 the	 latter	 is	 what	 we’re	 going	 to	 pick.	 Just	 like	 the	first	 washing
machines	and	coffeemakers,	Voice-First	platforms	will	save	people	time.	Once
the	masses	understand	that,	they	are	going	to	flock	to	them.	Be	there	ready	and
waiting	when	they	do.
Your	Flash	Briefing	will	be	a	one-minute	version	of	your	one-hour	podcast,	a
one-minute	audio	version	of	your	eight-minute	videos	or	live	streams,	or	a	one-
minute	selection	of	your	pretty	pictures	on	Instagram.	You	can	bring	people	so
much	value	right	now,	whether	you	create	for	Google,	Amazon,	or	both.	While
brands	have	developed	countless	Skills,	most	deliver	the	same	basic	experience.
The	field	is	clear	for	anyone	who	is	clever	enough	to	come	up	with	something

fresh	and	new.	Take	the	landgrab,	my	friends,	and	become	a	vital	part	of	your
consumers’	morning	routines.	Very	soon,	as	even	more	brands	jump	onto	these
platforms,	it	will	get	harder	to	make	a	dent	in	people’s	awareness.	Don’t	let	this
moment	pass.	Don’t	let	the	big	guys	snap	up	all	the	cheap	real	estate.	Please,	put
down	this	book	right	now	and	go	create	your	Skill.	Your	one-minute	audio	tip	of
the	day	could	be	the	thing	that	compels	a	person	to	put	on	your	podcast	during
their	morning	commute	instead	of	their	usual	NPR	or	classic	rock.
Skills	101
Keep	your	content	super	brief.
Make	it	native.	Do	not	do	what	I	did	with	my	original	podcast	when	I
just	transferred	the	audio	from	a	video	onto	the	podcast	platform.	Tailor
your	content	to	suit	the	reason	people	are	coming,	which	is	to	get	fast,
easily	digestible	information	nuggets.	“Hey,	Alexa	users	.	.	.”
Make	it	the	highest	quality	possible.	I	cannot	stress	how	important	it	is
that	you	not	treat	your	Skill	as	a	dumping	ground.	It’s	great	to	collect	the
scraps	from	your	other	content	so	they	don’t	go	to	waste,	but	study	each
piece	closely	and	use	your	imagination	and	creativity	to	craft	something
new	and	fresh	with	them.
You	know	how	it’s	such	an	irritating	process	to	get	off	an	e-mail	list?	First,
you	have	to	bother	to	go	to	the	bottom	of	the	e-mail	and	hunt	for	the	unsubscribe
button.	Then	you	have	to	plod	through	a	box	asking	if	you	are	absolutely	sure
you	want	to	leave,	and	would	you	care	to	share	the	reason?	And	then	finally,
upon	confirming	that	you’ve	been	unsubscribed,	you’re	told	it	could	take	a	few
business	days	before	the	e-mails	stop	coming.
In	 Voice-First,	 all	 people	 will	 have	 to	 do	 once	 they	 lose	 interest	 in	 your
content	is	say,	“Alexa,	remove	MumboJumbo’s	Flash	Briefing,”	and	boom,	it
will	be	done.	You	will	have	no	room	for	error.	No	room	to	be	annoying	or	too
long	or	low	quality.	Go	ahead	and	document	the	process	while	you	learn	how	to
craft	your	content—you	can	use	clips	from	all	that	material	for	other	content—
but	make	sure	whatever	segment	you	publish	is	short	and	tight.	You	will	need	to
be	remarkable	right	out	of	the	gate,	or	in	three	milliseconds,	you’ll	be	shut	down.
Voice-First	is	going	to	become	a	huge	pillar	in	our	communications.	By	the
time	this	book	is	published,	Amazon	Alexa,	Google	Assistant,	Apple	Siri,	or
some	other	platform	will	be	talking	to	us	in	our	cars.	Remember	when	we	all

thought	it	was	amazing	that	we	could	be	driving	along,	recall	that	we	used	to
love	Kenny	Rogers’s	“Lady,”	and	download	his	greatest	hits	as	soon	as	we	got	to
our	destination	(because	we	would	never	do	that	while	driving,	right?).	Soon,	we
won’t	have	to	wait	to	play	a	song	or	pull	over	to	type	in	a	location	on	a	map	app.
We’ll	just	tell	Alexa	what	we	want	her	to	do,	and	she’ll	do	it.	Finally,	texting	and
driving	will	be	a	thing	of	the	past—unless	we’re	in	our	driverless	cars.
Skills	201
There	is	no	Skills	201.	The	feature	is	so	new,	we’re	only	just	now	identifying
best	 practices.	 I	 hope	 you’ll	 share	 yours	 with	me	 as	 you	 discover	 them	 and
explore	all	the	exciting	possibilities	in	this	space.	Hit	me	up	at	@garyvee.
My	intuition	is	that	all	the	brands	in	the	how-to	space	will	flock	to	Voice-First
by	2020,	and	they	will	battle	to	be	the	ones	chosen	to	teach	people	to	make
cookies	and	pair	wine	and	get	better	at	chess	and	clean	carpets.	It’ll	be	our	on-
the-go	resource,	too.	When	changing	our	oil	in	the	garage,	we	won’t	pull	out	the
car	manual	or	Google	“How	to	change	your	oil.”	We’ll	just	call	out,	“Tell	me
how	 to	 change	 my	 oil,”	 and	 the	 Voice-First	 technology	 sitting	 on	 a	 shelf	 or
mounted	on	the	wall	will	ask	us	what	kind	of	car	we	drive,	then	walk	us	through
the	process	with	step-by-step	instructions.	Right	now	we’re	putting	Voice-First
tech	in	only	one	or	two	rooms	in	the	house.	In	the	future,	we	won’t	go	anywhere
without	it.
Imagine	This:	Alexa	Skills
Let’s	say	you’re	a	forty-nine-year-old	etiquette	coach	named	Marlo.	You	used
to	think	you’d	be	educating	children	in	the	finer	points	of	polite	conversation
and	 the	 continental	 style	 of	 eating,	 but	 over	 time	 your	 services	 have	 been
increasingly	sought	out	by	companies	desperate	to	fill	in	the	educational	gaps	of
their	 millennial	 hires.	 They	 just	 don’t	 know	 anything	 about	proper	 protocol,
especially	 for	 international	 business	 or	 formal	 affairs.	 Your	 business	 is	 doing
OK,	but	things	are	starting	to	feel	routine.
You’re	at	your	boyfriend’s	house	one	morning,	and	you	hear	him	ask	Alexa	to
tell	 him	 what’s	 in	 the	 news.	 A	 seemingly	 human	voice	 reads	 the	 morning
headlines,	then	the	weather,	some	sports	stats,	and	a	fun	fact	of	the	day,	all	from
different	media	outlets.

Fun	 fact	 of	 the	 day?	 That’s	 not	 news;	 that’s	 just	 learning	 for	 the	 sake	 of
learning.
A	lightbulb	goes	on.
You	 spend	 the	 next	 few	 weeks	 recording	 the	 answers	 to	 every	 etiquette
question	you	can	think	of.	How	do	you	fold	a	napkin	for	a	formal	table?	Should	I
invite	my	boss	to	my	birthday	dinner?	What’s	the	best	icebreaker	question?	How
do	I	end	a	conversation	at	a	cocktail	party	without	being	rude?	Can	I	wear	black
sneakers	with	a	black	suit?	You	could	have	asked	your	phone	these	questions,
but	you	look	up	“How	to	build	an	Alexa	Skill”	online	and	learn	that	there’s	a
studio	just	a	few	miles	away	that	will	help	you	record	the	audio	file.	You	upload
your	new	Alexa	Skill,	The	Manners	Maven,	and	announce	it	to	your	clients	and
on	all	your	content	channels.	They	love	the	way	the	platforms	let	them	engage
with	you	in	a	virtual	one-on-one.	It	gives	them	confidence.	Eventually,	you	add
“calls	to	action”	to	direct	people	to	other	pieces	of	your	content	on	the	Internet
so	they	can	discover	longer	versions	of	the	answers	they	got	from	you	here,	as
well	as	guest	posts	from	other	experts	and	interviews	with	people	sharing	their
funniest,	most	awkward	faux	pas.
Imagine	This:	Flash	Briefings
Let’s	 say	 you’re	 a	 thirty-seven-year-old	 landscaper	 named	 Johnny.	 Your
business,	Johnny’s	Landscape	Art,	nets	around	$200,000	per	year.	You	decide
that	 you	 need	 to	 boost	 your	 brand	 awareness,	 so	 you	 launch	 eleven	 Flash
Briefings:	Johnny’s	Daily	Yard	Tips—Zone	1,	Johnny’s	Daily	Yard	Tips—Zone
2,	and	so	on.	Every	day	of	the	year,	you	offer	the	country	seasonal	information
that	will	help	gardeners	tend	their	yards	better,	tailored	for	each	of	the	eleven
USDA	 plant	 hardiness	 zones,	 which	 are	 based	 on	 a	 region’s	 minimum
temperatures.

	 “It’s	 April	 21,	 and	 spring	 has	 sprung.	 Zone	4,	you’re	going	to
want	to	start	fertilizing	those	spring	bulbs.	Zone	9	friends,	I	want	you	to	consider
planting	citrus.	Zone	6,	now	that	your	forsythia	is	blooming,	make	sure	not	to
wait	too	long	to	prune	it,	or	it’ll	be	scraggly	next	year.”	You’re	the	first	of	your
kind	on	Amazon,	and	you’re	really	good	at	this.	The	love	you	have	for	your
work	and	your	playful	nature	come	through	bright	and	shiny	to	the	gardeners
and	homeowners	who	add	one	of	your	Flash	Briefings	to	their	morning	lineup.
Meanwhile,	Yvette	in	Seattle	is	in	charge	of	curating	the	Alexa	Skills	Store,
and	she	is	bored.	Every	Flash	Briefing	is	the	same	news-tech-weather-sports	shit

over	and	over	and	.	.	.	wait	a	minute.	What’s	this	Johnny’s	Daily	Yard	Tip?	Well,
that’s	different.	Different	is	good.	She	features	one	of	them	on	the	Skills	page.
And	 this,	this,	 is	 why	 you	 want	 to	 create	 content	 for	 Alexa	 now.	 What
Facebook	 did	 for	 social-network	 games	 and	 Apple	 did	 for	 apps,	 Amazon	is
going	to	do	for	Skills	and	Flash	Briefings.	They’re	going	to	run	commercials	to
raise	awareness	about	their	new	product.	Can	you	imagine	if	your	voice	is	the
one	the	whole	country	hears	as	an	example	of	a	great	Flash	Briefing?	It	could	do
for	you	 what	 Apple’s	 choosing	 to	 play	 “1234”	 in	 their	 2007	 iPod	 Nano
commercial	did	for	Feist.
Here’s	 the	 very	 best	 part.	 You	 know	 how	 I’m	 always	 telling	 you	 that
everything	I	want	you	to	do	is	going	to	be	hard	and	take	scads	of	patience?	Not
this	 time.	 It	 will	 not	 take	 you	 too	 much	 time	 or	 effort	 to	 be	 discovered	 for
creating	a	Flash	Briefing	because	of	the	early	novelty.	It	will	five	years	from
now,	however.	Five	years	from	now,	everyone	will	have	a	Flash	Briefing,	and	it’s
highly	unlikely	that	yours	will	get	noticed	without	marketing	the	living	shit	out
of	it	to	get	exposure.	Five	years	from	now,	the	moment	will	be	gone.	Do.	Not.
Wait.
Because	you	know	what	else	happens	to	you,	Johnny?	Your	Flash	Briefings
are	featured,	take	off,	and	suddenly	you	get	an	e-mail	from	Cindy	in	Missouri,
asking	 if	 you’re	 interested	 in	 franchising	 your	 now	 nationally	 known	 brand.
Within	 two	 years,	 your	$200,000-a-year	 landscaping	 business	 is	 collecting	 a
$25,000	check	each	year	from	seven	hundred	people	all	over	the	country.
Incidentally,	 Marlo	 the	 Manners	 Maven	 should	 do	 this,	 too,	 in	 addition	 to
making	her	Skill.	She	should	make	a	new	recording	of	365	etiquette	questions,
one	 for	 every	 day	 of	 the	 year.	 Did	 you	 know	 that	 even	 in	 the	 digital	 age,	 a
handwritten	thank-you	note	should	always	be	sent	after	a	job	interview?	Did	you
know	that	the	word	etiquette	is	derived	from	the	French	word	for	“ticket”	and
King	Louis	XIV’s	attempts	to	keep	visitors	from	trampling	his	gardens?

	She
needs	to	do	this	for	the	simple	reason	that	she	can,	because	the	cost	of	Internet
real	estate	today	is	still	so,	so	low.	Don’t	be	the	2017	first-time	home	buyer	in
Malibu;	 be	 goddamn	 Thomas	 Jefferson	 buying	 about	 eight	 hundred	 thousand
square	miles	 of	 Louisiana	 Territory	 for	 three	 cents	 an	 acre	 in	 1803	 dollars
(skipping	the	part	about	screwing	the	Native	Americans	already	living	on	that
land).

On	the	Horizon
While	I	was	working	on	this	book,	Amazon	announced	that	it	had	bought	Whole
Foods	for	just	over	$13.4	billion.	We	all	woke	up	to	the	news	and	thought,	How
the	fuck	did	that	happen?	It	never	should	have.	Whole	Foods	should	have	bought
Amazon.	There	was	a	time	twenty	years	ago	when	Whole	Foods	was	a	much
bigger	business	than	Amazon,	and	when	your	company	is	that	much	bigger	than
someone	else’s,	with	that	much	of	a	lead,	yours	should	never	lose.	If	it	does,	it’s
because	your	opposite	number	innovated	ahead	of	you.
To	 those	 who	 think	 they	 don’t	 have	 to	 invest	 in	 all	 the	 platforms	 because
they’re	 concentrating	 their	 efforts	 where	 they’re	seeing	 the	 most	 ROI,	 I	 say
you’re	being	foolish.	I	can	think	of	several	bloggers	who	were	massively	popular
in	2004.	It	was	the	new	frontier,	and	they	had	positioned	themselves	front	and
center,	but	they	ignored	the	rise	of	YouTube	and	podcasts	and	Twitter,	and	now
they’re	irrelevant.	They	found	something	that	worked	and	preferred	to	rest	on
their	laurels	rather	than	stay	hungry	and	sharp.	They	thumbed	their	noses	at
traditional	media,	but	then	they	became	traditional	media.
We	 see	 it	 all	 the	 time.	 ESPN	 made	Sports	Illustrated	 look	 old.	Bleacher
Report	is	in	the	process	of	making	ESPN	look	fusty.	Barstool	Sports	is	already
starting	to	make	Bleacher	Report	feel	stale.	It	happened	to	Macy’s.	It	happened
to	Radio	Shack,	Woolworth’s,	Tower	Records,	Nokia	.	.	.	They	crushed,	they
stagnated,	they	died.	They	are	no	different	from	any	brand	crushing	it	today.	One
day	we	could	have	a	WTF	moment	upon	hearing	that	Ralph	Lauren	filed	for
Chapter	11	bankruptcy	protection	or	that	GQ	no	longer	exists.	Learn	the	lesson
now:	everyone	is	playing	the	same	game.	If	you	don’t	play	offense	all	the	time,
every	day,	every	year,	no	matter	how	successful	you	become,	someday	you	will
wind	up	playing	defense.
You	have	to	keep	looking	ahead.	I’ve	got	my	eye	on	Marco	Polo,	Anchor,
After	 School,	 AR	 (augmented	 reality),	 VR	 (virtual	 reality),	and	 AI	 (artificial
intelligence).	You	know	what’s	going	to	happen?	One	day	there’s	going	to	be	a
little	ball	hanging	above	every	single	human	being’s	head	recording	everything
they	do.	Swear	to	God,	it’s	going	to	happen.	Maybe	it’ll	be	a	camera	embedded
in	 your	 body.	 I	 don’t	 know	 the	 details,	 but	 I	 know	 that	 recording	 and
documenting	every	minute	of	our	lives	will	seem	perfectly	normal	one	day.	You
might	think	it	sounds	awful,	and	even	scary,	but	just	imagine	if	you	could	watch
your	 grandmother	right	 now.	 Imagine	 seeing	 her	 move	 through	 her	 life	 as	 a
young	woman,	watching	her	fall	in	love	with	your	grandpa,	raising	her	kids,
your	mom,	or	starting	a	new	job—not	as	though	you’re	watching	a	movie,	but

feeling	as	if	you’re	physically	moving	through	her	world	with	her.	That’s	how
real	the	technology	is	going	to	be.	The	question	is	not	if	but	when.
The	passion	I	have	deployed	around	Alexa	Flash	Skills	is	the	same	passion	I
had	for	Twitter	and	YouTube	in	2008	when	I	wrote	this	book’s	mother,	Crush	It!,
back	 when	 the	 masses	 didn’t	 know	 what	 the	 fuck	 I	 was	 talking	 about.	 Now
people	know	what	I’m	talking	about	when	it	comes	to	Twitter	and	Instagram	and
YouTube,	but	they	aren’t	doing	the	next	step.	They	aren’t	tasting	and	trying	and
experimenting.	They’re	leaving	that	up	to	me.	They	shouldn’t.	They	should	be
out	there	with	me	trying	things	out	for	themselves.
You	shouldn’t	have	to	turn	to	me	to	ask	what’s	next.	What	do	you	see?	All	I’m
doing	is	looking	toward	the	horizon	to	see	what	platforms	are	capturing	people’s
attention	 and	 altering	 their	behavior.	 If	 I	 see	 something	 that	 is	 performing
consistently,	 I	 take	 a	 closer	 look,	 and	 then	 a	 longer	 look,	 and	 then	 I	 start	to
execute.	That’s	all	you	have	to	do,	too.	I	don’t	have	second	sight;	I	just	have	a	lot
more	patience	than	you	do.
How	I’m	Crushing	It
Andy	Frisella,	The	MFCEO	Project
IG:	@AndyFrisella
Andy	Frisella	looks	like	a	man	who	could	squash	your	head
like	a	grapefruit.	For	someone	in	his	line	of	work,	that’s	a	good
thing.	Built	and	buff,	his	face	lightly	scarred	from	a	long-ago
knife	 attack,	 Andy	 is	 the	 founder	 and	 CEO—actually,	 the
MFCEO	(I’ll	 let	 you	 guess	 what	 the	 MF	 stands	 for)—of	 two
companies	dedicated	to	fitness	and	health.	A	voracious	reader,
he	found	Crush	It!	by	chance.	He	regularly	buys	books	as	they
come	 out	 on	 Amazon	 regardless	 of	 whether	 he’s	 heard	 good
things	about	them	or	not,	figuring	that	if	he	can	glean	even	one
or	two	useful	pointers	or	thought-provoking	ideas	from	each,	his
time	has	been	well	spent.	At	the	time	of	Crush	It!’s	publication,
Andy	 had	 already	 been	 in	 business	 ten	 years,	 selling	 sports
nutrition	products	through	his	Missouri-based	brick-and-mortar
chain,	Supplement	Superstores	(S2).	Despite	eight	locations,	S2
was	doing	what	most	businesses	do—treading	water.	Business

was	good	but	not	great,	certainly	not	enough	for	Andy	to	take
home	more	than	about	$50,000	a	year.	It	was	all	a	single	guy	at
the	time	needed	to	pay	the	rent	and	enjoy	dinner	out	every	now
and	 then,	 but	 Andy’s	 ambitions	 had	 been	significantly	 bigger
when	he	and	his	business	partner,	Chris	Klein,	had	launched	the
original	 store.	 All	 his	 life,	 Andy	 had	been	 entrepreneurial,
selling	baseball	cards,	snow	cones,	even	lightbulbs	door-to-door.
He	liked	making	money,	and	he	was	frustrated	that	he	couldn’t
get	the	business	to	grow	faster.	Yet	although	he	wasn’t	bringing
in	 the	 returns	 he’d	 thought	 he	would,	 it	 was	 sure	 better	 than
working	for	somebody	else.	No	matter	what,	he	wasn’t	about	to
give	up	and	go	get	a	“real	job.”	So	Andy	decided	that	if	doing
something	else	wasn’t	an	option,	he’d	need	to	focus	on	the	part
of	the	business	that	he	did	enjoy—helping	people	create	their
stories.	Customers	would	visit	his	stores	and	return	six	months
later	 completely	 transformed	after	 using	 the	 knowledge	 and
products	they’d	taken	home	with	them.	Some	had	lost	as	much
as	a	hundred	pounds;	many	had	dramatically	changed	their	lives.
So	 Andy	 doubled	 down	 on	 doing	 right	 by	 his	 customers,
making	sure	they	left	his	store	feeling	confident	and	equipped
with	everything	they	needed	to	achieve	their	goals.	Store	traffic
immediately	picked	up.
Everybody	 knows	 when	 they’re	 being	 sold.	 No	 matter	 how	 slick	 and
cool	and	shiny	a	salesman	is,	customers	recognize	a	fucking	salesman.
We	all	 know	 them.	 And	 so	 when	 you	 have	 somebody	 who	genuinely
cares,	people	feel	the	difference.	They	feel	it	in	the	conversation	and	in
their	heart.	And	it	has	to	come	from	a	genuine	place,	or	it	doesn’t	work.
It	was	around	this	time	that	he	found	Crush	It!,	which	also
talked	about	caring	about	customers	and	focusing	on	what	you
are	providing	others	as	opposed	to	focusing	on	yourself.	It	was	a
pivot	point,	reinforcing	his	instincts	and	confirming	that	he	was
taking	the	business	in	the	right	direction.
I	was	passionate	about	making	money,	and	that’s	what	held	me	back	for
so	 long.	 I	 wanted	 to	 make	 money	 so	 bad	 that	 all	 I	 cared	about	 was
making	 money,	 like	 most	 of	 these	 dudes	 who	 are	 trying	 to	 start
businesses.	And	when	you’re	always	focused	on	the	money,	you	don’t
really	think	about	what	you	could	do	better	for	your	customers.	When	I
shifted	that	focus	and	started	caring	about	the	customer	in	front	of	me,
things	started	happening.	I’m	not	super	passionate	about	bodybuilding,

I’m	not	a	workout	freak.	I	work	out	and	stay	in	good	shape,	but	it’s	just
part	of	what	I	do	so	I	can	do	other	things.	I’m	passionate	about	creating
people’s	success	stories.
Andy	and	Chris	reallocated	a	large	chunk	of	their	marketing
budget	to	improving	their	in-store	customer	transactions.	They
handed	out	free	T-shirts.	They	hired	extra	staff	to	advise	people
on	their	nutrition.	They	kept	a	clutch	of	umbrellas	by	the	door
for	people	to	take	with	them	if	it	started	to	rain.	In	short,	they
provided	a	customer	experience	completely	different	from	what
most	people	are	used	to.
Their	business	doubled.	Every	year.	For	five	years	in	a	row.
Eventually	 they	 increased	 their	 advertising	 and	 marketing
budget.	“Advertising	should	be	used	to	accelerate	the	stories	that
are	being	told	about	you.	People	were	finding	us,	coming	into
our	 company,	 staying,	 and	 referring	 their	 friends.	 If	 people
aren’t	telling	good	stories,	all	advertising	is	going	to	do	is	speed
your	death.”
The	 year	 2009	 also	 saw	 Andy	 and	 Chris	 start	 another
company,	1st	Phorm,	a	premium	brand	of	supplements.	This	one
was	founded	from	the	get-go	on	the	principles	Andy	had	finally
realized	were	critical	to	business	success.
The	 marketing	 strategy	 to	 build	 1st	 Phorm	 was	 simple	 and
grassroots—care	 about	 the	 customers,	 give	 them	 exactly	 what
they	want	and	more,	and	then	create	opportunities	for	them	to
easily	 tell	 others	 about	 their	 great	 experience.	 That’s	 where
social	media	came	in.	Andy	had	been	on	Facebook	for	a	while
but	 hadn’t	 been	 using	 it	 properly.	 Now	 he	 took	 a	 strategic
approach,	going	heavy	on	valuable	content	instead	of	constant
pictures	of	his	dog	(though	Andy’s	dogs	still	get	plenty	of	screen
time,	and	deservedly	so),	creating	a	place	where	his	community
could	come	together.	In	addition,	he	started	building	his	personal
brand.	 He	 tried	 Twitter	 but	 struggled	 to	 cram	 everything	 he
wanted	to	say	into	140	characters,	so	though	@1stPhorm	has	a
healthy	following,	you	won’t	find	Andy	himself	there.	He	calls
Snapchat	an	“edifying”	tool	because	it	allows	the	world	to	see
the	real-life,	behind-the-scenes	work	of	entrepreneurship,	though
he	 admits	 he	 uses	 Instagram	 Stories	 more	 now.	 As	 for
Instagram,	he	did	exactly	the	opposite	of	what	normally	works
best	on	the	platform	(to	great	effect—he	has	over	six	hundred

thousand	followers).
I	post	pictures	and	videos	and	make	long-ass	captions.	And	when	I	first
started	 it,	 people	 told	 me,	 ‘Oh,	 nobody	 wants	 to	 read	this	 shit,’	 but
apparently	 they	 do.	 With	 social	 media,	 I	 think	 it’s	 more	 about	 being
authentic	to	yourself	and	finding	what’s	going	to	be	the	thing	that	suits
you	best,	versus	where	everybody	is	and	deciding	that’s	where	you	need
to	be.	It’s	about	finding	what	works	and	working	with	that.
Together,	 the	 companies	 grew	 from	 $1	 million	 in	 sales	 to
$100	million.	Andy	predicts	that	2018	will	see	in	excess	of	$200
million.
As	his	brand	and	businesses	swelled,	people	started	to	notice
that	Andy	knew	something	other	entrepreneurs	didn’t.	The	press
reached	out	to	get	his	story,	and	the	more	he	shared,	the	more
people	wanted	to	know.	He	met	a	writer,	Vaughn	Kohler,	who
suggested	he	write	a	book.	He	was	ready,	so	the	two	sat	down
for	a	series	of	interviews.	They	videotaped	their	sessions,	and
Andy	 thought	 some	 clips	 might	 make	 good	 content	 for
Instagram	and	Facebook.	Jackpot.	“They	started	going	crazy.	I
had	one	that	got	two	or	three	million	views,	and	it	was	a	fifteen-
second	clip!”
After	 each	 post,	 Andy	 would	 get	 messages	 from	 people
asking	where	they	could	hear	the	full	podcast,	so	Andy	figured
he’d	 better	start	 producing	 one.	 In	 June	 2015,	 he	 and	 Kohler
started	cohosting	The	MFCEO	Project,	a	motivational	podcast
about	business	and	success.	The	first	episode	debuted	at	number
one,	and	the	program	has	stayed	in	the	Top	50	in	the	managing
and	 marketing	category	 on	 iTunes	 since	 that	 day,	 earning	 1.5
million	downloads	per	month.	Andy’s	persona	and	fiery	delivery
made	him	a	natural	for	the	speaking	circuit,	and	the	invitations
started	flooding	in.	He	enjoys	public	speaking	so	much	that	he
accepts	every	opportunity	he	can,	“whether	it’s	five	people	or
five	thousand.”	Sometimes	when	he’s	moved	to	do	so,	he	speaks
for	free;	sometimes	he	gets	a	$50,000	fee	for	a	single	event.
Starting	in	spring	2017,	he	launched	a	YouTube	channel,	The
Frisella	 Factor,	 on	 which	 he	 answers	 his	 podcast	 listeners’	 e-
mailed	questions.
It	took	eighteen	years	for	Andy	to	get	to	where	he	is	now,	and
he	 envies	 the	 younger	 generation	 of	 entrepreneurs,	 who	 have

never	known	a	world	where	they	couldn’t	connect	to	the	bigger
world	with	the	click	of	a	mouse.	However,	he	also	thinks	that	the
younger	 generation	 would	 do	 well	 to	 remember	 that	 certain
values	and	business	practices	are	timeless.
My	journey	took	much	longer	than	it	should	have.	We	created	our	first
business	 pre–social	 media,	 building	 everything	 through	real	 word	 of
mouth.	Our	second	business	was	created	post–social	media.	So	we’ve
done	it	in	both	eras.	And	the	reason	that	we’re	successful	is	because	the
lessons	we	learned	pre-social	are	applicable	to	post-social;	you	just	have
to	use	the	tools	the	right	way	to	accelerate	the	word	of	mouth.	But	if
you’re	 starting	 out	 right	 now,	 if	 it	 takes	 you	 seventeen	 years,	 there’s
something	wrong	with	your	brain.	You	can	reach	people	instantly,	and
you	get	instant	feedback.	All	the	things	that	took	us	months	and	years	to
figure	 out	 could	 be	 known	 in	 a	 short	 amount	 of	 time.	 Now	 you	 can
connect	with	people	all	over	the	world	on	a	minute-by-minute	basis.	The
kids	now	that	are	starting	out	are	lucky.
But	they’re	handicapped,	too.	They	rely	too	much	on	the	social.	They
rely	too	much	on	the	likes,	the	shares,	the	messaging,	and	not	enough	on
the	 face-to-face	 interactions.	 And	 learning	 how	 to	 create	 customer
experience	comes	from	face-to-face,	man.	You	know,	seeing	somebody’s
eyes	light	up,	seeing	somebody	smile,	seeing	somebody	reach	out	and
shake	your	hand	and	say,	“Thank	you	so	much	for	helping	me	with	this.	I
really	 appreciate	 it.”	 That’s	 shit	 you	 can’t	 get	 through	 the	 Internet.
Unless	 they	can	 go	 through	 that	 process,	 they’re	 always	 going	 to	 be
trying	to	automate.	And	that’s	why	you	see	so	many	people	creating	a
product	 that	 they	 sell,	 versus	 creating	 a	 true	 brand	 that	 represents
something.	If	you	can	bridge	these	two	things	together	[the	social	media
smarts	 with	 the	 skills	 to	 engage	 face-to-face	 with	 empathy	 and	 care],
you’ve	really	got	something	special.

Conclusion
I’m	often	asked	what	I’ve	learned	in	the	years	since	I	published	Crush	It!	The
answer	is	this:	I	was	right.	Social	media	does	equal	business.	Innovation	makes
people	uncomfortable.	We	should	care	desperately	about	everything,	yet	not	care
at	all	what	anyone	else	thinks.	Someone	will	always	be	trying	to	tear	you	down.
Talent	has	little	value	without	patience	and	persistence.	Success	takes	a	shitload
of	work,	and	the	people	who	ultimately	break	through	and	crush	it	are	those	who
get	all	that	and	go	for	their	dreams	anyway.
I	 want	 you	 to	 find	 your	 courage	 and	 go	 for	 it.	 Somewhere	 out	 there	 is	 a
middle-aged	engineer,	a	single-parent	exterminator,	or	a	department	store	sales
clerk	trying	to	get	through	school	who	is	reading	this	book	and	thinking,	Man,	I
fucking	hate	this	job.	But	I	love	pizza.	I’m	going	to	start	a	YouTube	channel	and
become	the	next	Mario	Batali.	People	will	think	it’s	a	ridiculous	idea,	just	as
people	thought	I	was	ridiculous	when	I	wrote	Crush	It!	But	it’s	not	ridiculous.
It’s	 not	 even	 sweetly	 optimistic.	 The	 proof	 is	 in	 the	 pudding.	 When	 I	 wrote
Crush	It!,	I	was	basically	just	telling	the	world	what	I	had	done	to	grow	a	wine
store	in	New	Jersey.	Now	as	I	write,	I’m	a	judge	on	Apple’s	first	original	show.
I	hope	this	book	has	inspired	you	to	change	your	life	for	the	better.	People
often	tell	me	they	want	to	be	like	me.	I’d	rather	you	be	like	you,	but	if	you	really
want	to	be	like	me,	quit	being	a	student	of	entrepreneurship	and	start	doing	the
goddamn	work.	If	you	do,	this	will	be	the	last	business	book	you’ll	need	to	read.
Success	will	happen	faster	for	some	people	than	for	others,	but	if	you’re	loving
life	and	doing	what	you	feel	you	were	born	to	do,	you’ll	be	going	in	the	right
direction.	Stay	the	course.	It	pays	to	be	brave.	If	it	helps,	think	of	me	as	the
shield	between	you	and	all	the	negativity	out	there.	Believe	me,	I’ve	heard	every
criticism	and	weathered	every	insult.	I’ve	had	to	defend	my	position	thousands

of	times,	and	I’ve	faced	disappointments.	I’ve	taken	all	the	punches,	and	I’m	not
only	still	standing,	but	I’m	stronger	than	ever.	There	is	nothing	anyone	can	throw
at	you	that	they	haven’t	already	thrown	at	me.	If	I	can	stomach	it,	so	can	you—if
you	want	to	crush	it	badly	enough.
Remember,	 you’re	 not	 trading	 in	 your	 day	 job	 for	 an	 easier	 life—there’s
nothing	easy	about	becoming	an	entrepreneur	and	influencer.	You’re	trading	it	in
for	 a	 different	 life,	 one	 with	 more	 flexibility	 and	 fun.	 Chad	 Collins	 (Twitter:
@chadcollins)	 credits	Crush	 It!	with	 helping	 him	 create	 his	 seven-figure
companies	and	two	Guinness	World	Record–breaking	fan	festivals,	LEGO	Brick
Fest	Live	and	Minefaire,	out	of	a	YouTube	channel	he	created	with	his	seven-
year-old	daughter.	Collins	actively	tried	to	avoid	the	entrepreneurial	life,	because
he	knew	how	hard	it	could	be.	“I	grew	up	in	a	family	of	entrepreneurs,	and	when
it	was	going	well,	awesome.	When	it	was	bad,	it	was	really	bad.	I	made	a	choice
to	work	for	The	Man	on	purpose.”	But	he	wasn’t	happy	being	an	“intrapreneur,”
and	 when	 he	 saw	 a	 chance	 to	 create	 the	 life	 of	 his	 dreams,	 he	 jumped.	 He
believes	the	experience	has	primed	his	daughter	for	success,	too,	no	matter	what
path	she	pursues.	“Jordyn	was	interviewed	by	Time	for	Kids,	which	featured	her
on	the	site’s	home	page.	Since	she	turned	nine,	she	has	run	the	LEGO	trivia
presentation	 at	 the	 events.	She	 owns	 it.	 She	 creates	 her	 own	 PowerPoint
presentation.	Seeing	how	it	got	started,	she	knows	she	will	be	able	to	accomplish
anything	she	wants	to.	She	and	my	son	have	seen	it	all	play	out.	She’ll	succeed
as	long	as	she	keeps	the	confidence	that	she	has	and	applies	it	to	whatever	she
does.”	 Yes,	 she	 will.	 And	 so	 will	 anyone	 willing	 to	 take	 a	 risk	 and	 take	 the
principles	of	this	book	to	heart.	Please,	please,	just	try,	if	not	for	yourself,	then
for	the	people	you	love	who	are	watching	you	and	who	want	you	to	be	happy.
You	know	where	we	are	in	this	game?	We	haven’t	even	heard	the	national
anthem.	We	haven’t	even	gotten	to	the	parking	lot.	I	cannot	wait	to	see	what
platforms	we’re	talking	about	in	nine	more	years.	I’m	never	afraid	of	the	future.
It’s	practically	a	national	sport	to	reminisce	about	how	much	easier	and	slower
life	was	in	the	past.	People	wonder	if	we’re	sacrificing	something	irreplaceable,
perhaps	 even	 changing	 the	 human	 condition,	 as	 we	 become	 increasingly
obsessed	 with	 speed	 and	 productivity.	I	 don’t	 worry	 about	 it	 because	 we	 are
simply	doing	what	we’ve	always	done,	what	we	were	probably	born	to	do.	We
wax	nostalgic,	but	our	actions	betray	us.	How	many	people	above	the	age	of
thirteen	in	America	do	not	have	a	cell	phone?	Practically	no	one.	As	long	as	we
exist,	 humans	will	 continue	 to	 embrace	 whatever	 inventions	 and	 innovations
offer	us	the	most	speed	and	convenience.	You’re	not	going	to	lose	your	soul	if
you	do	this.	In	fact,	if	you’re	truly	an	entrepreneur,	you’re	going	to	get	it	back.

Acknowledgments
Five	has	always	been	my	favorite	number,	so	as	I	publish	my	fifth	business
book,	it’s	especially	important	that	I	acknowledge	the	team	that	I	value	most	in
the	 world—my	 amazing	 wife,	 Lizzie;	 my	 kids,	 Misha	 and	 Xander;	 my
unbelievable	parents,	Sasha	and	Tamara;	and	my	siblings	and	in-laws.	I	am	only
able	to	live	this	life	because	of	the	love	and	the	infrastructure	you	offer	me.	I
thank	you	from	the	bottom	of	my	heart.
I	 also	 want	 to	 give	 a	 huge	 shout-out	 to	 the	 entire	 Team	 GaryVee,	 which
contributed	their	efforts	and	expertise	to	this	book,	as	well	as	all	the	people	that
surround	me	on	a	daily	basis	whose	talent	and	heart	make	VaynerMedia	what	it
is.	In	addition,	I	owe	enormous	gratitude	to	the	entire	team	at	HarperBusiness,
especially	my	editor,	Hollis	Heimbouch.
Finally,	there	is	no	shot	that	any	of	these	books	would	exist	without	my	right
hand,	Stephanie	Land,	who	has	collaborated	with	me	on	all	five	of	them.	She	has
become	much	more	than	a	ghostwriter.	She	is	my	friend.

child,	this	might	not	be	a	bad	place	to	let	him	 or	 her	 showcase	 their	 talents.
You’re	never	too	young	to	start	building	a	personal	brand.	Can	you	imagine	if
Justin	Bieber’s	mom	had	banned	him	from	YouTube?	Maybe	manager	Scooter
Braun	or	some	other	talent	scout	would	have	discovered	him	anyway.	But	maybe
they	wouldn’t	have,	and	now	Bieber	could	be	just	another	physical	therapist	with
a	beautiful	voice	who’d	always	have	to	wonder,	“What	if?”

*	For	explicit	instructions	on	how	to	create	and	upload	your	own,	read	my
blog	post	called	“How	to	Create	and	Use	Snapchat’s	New	Custom	Geofilters,”
https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/how-to-create-and-use-snapchats-new-
custom-geofilters.

*	Many	sports	internships	are	going	to	require	that	applicants	be	enrolled	in	a
degree	program	or	be	a	recent	graduate	of	one,	so	in	this	case,	make	your	tuition
worthwhile	and	do	your	best.

*	See?	When	I	tell	you	that	it’s	not	worth	sacrificing	long-term	success	for
short-term	economic	gain,	I	speak	from	experience.	When	I	finally	got	around	to
building	up	my	YouTube	presence	around	2015,	I	had	only	about	forty	thousand
subscribers.	 Imagine	how	 many	 millions	 more	 people	 I	 could	 have	 reached
during	all	that	time	if	I	hadn’t	had	my	head	turned	by	Viddler’s	lucrative	offer.

*	Especially	if	you’re	into	sports.	I	predict	that	eventually	there	will	be	a	sport
that	will	be	built	from	scratch	through	Facebook	Live	or	maybe	even	some	live
platform	that	doesn’t	yet	exist.	It	will	upend	the	televised	sports	industry	as	we
know	it.	Just	watch.

*	This	is	a	crucial	point,	one	that	I	outline	in	detail	in	another	book,	Jab,	Jab,
Jab,	Right	Hook.	If	you	don’t	already	understand	the	nuances	of	jabs	and	right
hooks,	pick	up	a	copy	and	figure	it	out	before	you	go	acting	like	a	slimeball.

*	I	know	that	this	is	still	a	too	common	scenario.	Many	organizations	simply
cannot	understand	that	it’s	in	their	best	interest	to	let	their	employees	be	real	on
social	media,	and	that	the	best	way	to	control	their	online	image	is	quite	simply
to	be	such	an	amazing	brand	and	create	such	a	supportive	work	environment	that
employees	have	only	good	things	to	say	about	them.	Unless	you	work	in	law	or
finance,	where	the	rules	are	a	little	different,	here’s	my	advice	for	those	of	you
working	 for	 companies	that	 won’t	 allow	 you	 to	 express	 yourself	 online	 and
create	a	personal	brand,	even	on	your	own	time:	Leave	as	soon	as	you	can,	and
go	work	for	one	that	will.	Better	yet,	start	your	own	thing,	as	Brittney	Castro	did
(see	Chapter	12).
