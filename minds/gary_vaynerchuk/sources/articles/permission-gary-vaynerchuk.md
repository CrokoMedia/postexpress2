# Permission! - Gary Vaynerchuk

For those of you that came here from page 121 of Crushing It! I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your time and attention. Nothing matters more to me than the consumption of this mission, which has been a decade’s long journey since my first book Crush It! put me on the map in 2009. Whether you bought the book, or stole a copy from bitTorrent or came from a URL that was shared on the internet 😉 .. my hope is that these principles will show you the blueprint around what’s worked for me and other great entrepreneurs in this book.

The takeaway from this chapter, and the video below, is that I am beyond fascinated with the idea of “permission” and allowing yourself to get past the mental roadblock of whatever in life is holding you back. When it comes to professional opportunities, this is the best time to be alive in the history of humankind and I don’t want anyone to waste it. Whatever it is that you want to do, please don’t allow yourself to be at the mercy of other people’s opinions. Not your mom or your boss or your boyfriend. 

We owe it to ourselves and our loved ones to be as fulfilled and thrilled as possible, so we can always be ready to share our best selves with each other. There is so much in life that is uncontrollable, but our happiness doesn’t have to be, nor do our careers. We can have all the control. Every damn bit of it. The sooner we realize that, the better off everyone will be.

Whether you enjoyed the book or hated it, it would mean the world to me if you [left a review on Amazon.](https://garyvee.com/Crushingit)

This book was 9 years in the making and I would be thrilled to hear your $0.02

Your comments are my oxygen and if Amazon isn’t your thing, a review on Insta or Medium is cool too 😉

#ThankYou

Gary
