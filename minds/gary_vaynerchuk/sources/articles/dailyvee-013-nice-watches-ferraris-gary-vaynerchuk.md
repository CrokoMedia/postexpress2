# DailyVee 013: Nice Watches & Ferraris

Yo Gary, just watched this DailyVee about the watches and Ferraris – gotta say, your perspective is always so refreshing! It’s cool how you break down the whole idea of wanting those kinds of things. It’s not just about showing off, right? It’s often tied to personal goals and celebrating achievements.

I totally get the hustle behind wanting those “trophies,” as some might call them. It’s like a reminder of the hard work you’ve put in. And your point about enjoying the journey and not just the destination? Spot on! It’s easy to get caught up in the end goal, but the process is where the real growth happens. Thanks for keeping it real and giving us something to think about! Keep the DailyVees coming! 🔥
