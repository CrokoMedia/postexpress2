# How to Create 64 Pieces Of Content In A Day

In my continued efforts to bring the most value to the entrepreneurs, operators, and marketers of the world, today on my 44th birthday, I’m releasing a deck that the team and I have worked on extensively over the last couple of months. 

We did it to inspire and, more importantly, to create the tactics and details around how you, your organization, your startup, or your Fortune 500 company can push the envelope to create more content than you ever thought possible. In a volume-centric creative world, it’s about creating more context for the audience you’re trying to reach and more context on the platforms that you’re distributing on. 

This deck continues my tradition of creating step-by-step guides that give you the exact tactics I’ve used to run my businesses and grow my audience. That includes references like [The Content Model](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/the-garyvee-content-strategy-how-to-grow-and-distribute-your-brands-social-media-content/), [The $1.80 Strategy](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/instagram-for-business-180-strategy-grow-business-brand/), [How to Tell a Story on Social Media](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/how-to-tell-a-story-on-social-media/), [LinkedIn Marketing Strategies](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/linkedin-marketing-strategies/) and [How To Network On Instagram DM](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/network-instagram-direct-message/).

I hope you find this new 270-page deck below massively valuable, and I’m extremely proud that it’s free. Happy birthday to you, from me, on my birthday 🙂

Please enjoy and share this with entrepreneurs, executives, and your friends – I genuinely believe this deck will help so many.
