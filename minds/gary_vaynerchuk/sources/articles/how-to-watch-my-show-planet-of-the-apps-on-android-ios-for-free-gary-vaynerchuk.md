## Oh and in case you were wondering:

During the show, Jessica, Gwyneth, Will and I listen to up and coming app developers during their 60 second “escalator pitch” (Stay tuned for the first episode to find out what I mean 😉 — describing their product and potential.

From that point, we all decide whether or not we would like to hear more from the individual or team. If one person votes yes, we allow the entrepreneur to elaborate on their idea. Once complete, one of the four judges has to vote on whether or not they would like to mentor that company for a chance to gain funding at the end of the show. Of course, if one or more judges say yes, the entrepreneur or team can decide who they would like as a partner on the show.

I like to describe Planet of The Apps as somewhere between Shark Tank and The Voice and I can’t wait for you to see the energy that I bring to the show! Oh, and in case you were wondering, I dominate! 😉

I hope you enjoy the series which will be streaming exclusively on [Apple Music](https://garyvee.com/AppleMusicGaryVee) (available on Android too). I would love for you to join the conversation once the show goes live by Tweeting at me. You can use the hashtag #PlanetOfTheApps and my handle @garyvee
