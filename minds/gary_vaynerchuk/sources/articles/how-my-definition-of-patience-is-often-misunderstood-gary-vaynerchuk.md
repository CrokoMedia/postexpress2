# How My Definition of Patience Is (Often) Misunderstood

  
Woke up this morning thinking about the process of patience and self love…and how it’s often misunderstood by some of you.

Wanting to have everything figured out at 25, dreaming to be a millionaire at 3o, and all of these unrealistic expectations that society imposes on you, would hurt you in terms of truly seeing your passion clearly…and that’s when you need self-compassion and patience the most.

A tweet I came across recently is spot on on the very misconceptions that keep floating around on what I mean by having patience and gave me the opportunity to speak more about it.

I’m empathetic to Leon’s tweet here but let’s not get our words all twisted…It’s never been about asking people to consciously be lazy, unresponsive or urgent on the opportunities they come across…The advice very much is to “Start now. Move fast. Don’t settle.” BUT, Haris’ response here would serve as a better example of what I constantly keep pushing.

It’s about giving yourself the credit and support that you need and keep pushing at any age. 

It’s about having the patience and optimism to turn your life around and start over without pondering over the past and the mistakes of the past.

I care about people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s to still go after their dreams because I believe most people have these limitations imposed by themselves of what they can and cannot do beyond a certain age…and I discard that idea completely.

I lead with my own example of not really being able to chase my dreams and create my own path until I was 34…I was working in a liquor store 365 days a year, I was _retail_…Then came talking about wine on the internet and investing in companies to now being able to build the world’s biggest companies and taking Fortune 500 companies as clients for my digital agency…but none of that was clear to me when I was a teen and that’s what is keep saying is––okay!

  
You can build a career at the age you want to. The point was never to stay lazy and let the opportunities go by in your 20s…it’s about maintaining the same level of enthusiasm to start over, create, progress, and win even when YOU are sadly mistaken about not having enough time. 

This isn’t about passiveness…to me…“Start now. Move fast. Don’t settle” is for 6, 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, and so on and…all inclusive! 

This is about not letting yourself fall prey to a dwelling mindset over what you think you’ve done wrong in the past but taking actionable steps in forward motion to go after your dreams.

I hope this helps you understand the very heart of my life philosophy when I keep spreading the same message again and again about having more time than you think.
