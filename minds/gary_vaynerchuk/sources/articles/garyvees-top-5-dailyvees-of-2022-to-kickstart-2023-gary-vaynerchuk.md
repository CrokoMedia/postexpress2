# GaryVee’s Top 5 DailyVees of 2022 (to kickstart 2023!)

With the help of my team, we’ve compiled some of my top pieces of content for 2022.

As many of you know, I don’t define “top” content according to vanity metrics. This isn’t necessarily about which posts received the most likes or comments. Instead, these are the core messages we hope – and think – brought you guys the most value last year. 

That being said, keep reading to see my top five DailyVees of 2022 – watch these to kickstart your 2023 the right way!!

## **“Is the Internet Hurting the Youth?” | DailyVee 608**

In this episode from July, I headed to Bucharest, Romania to speak at BrandMinds. During a fan Q&A session, I had one conversation with a mom that really stuck out. We talked about how parents can build their children’s self-esteem instead of blaming social media, and what’s really important. Check out that moment [here](https://youtu.be/_vu4duHK4fM?t=562), and watch the full episode below:

## **My Honest Opinion About Sales and Marketing | DailyVee 615**

DailyVee 615 was for all my entrepreneurs and business owners. If you’re looking to improve your sales strategy to get more customers in 2023, focus on adopting a modern marketing strategy so that your customers actually come to you instead of you having to chase them. Learn more and watch part of my keynote at DattoCon 2022 below:

## **Having Bad Days Can Make You Stronger (DailyVee 614)**

In this DailyVee from September, you’ll catch part of my convo with [The D’Amelio family](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIoBuVIZ9F30lmZ4ddTGnzw). We talked about parenting, being young in the public eye and a lot more. In the rest of this episode, you’ll watch some business meetings, me dealing with negative comments live, and the reason why I decided to invest in Tumblr.

## **Welcome Party – DailyVee 603 | VeeCon Day 1**

This was a special one as I took you behind-the-scenes of the inaugural VeeCon welcome party. This was such a surreal experience and unique event in my life, and I’m so glad I got to share it with so many of you. I can’t wait to see even more of you at the second VeeCon this year!

## **And This is Just the Beginning | DailyVee 606 VeeCon Day 4**

Finally, DailyVee 606 closed out the VeeCon recap with footage from the fourth and final day. Enjoy a powerful conversation between me, Snoop Dogg and his son, as well as my closing keynote speech.

Thank you so much for your attention last year and every year. I’m so grateful for every one of you.

If you enjoyed this recap, I’d love if you sent me a tweet [@garyvee](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=&text=%40garyvee) and shared the DailyVee episode that resonated with you the most.
