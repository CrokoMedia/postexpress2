# What I'm Excited For in 2018

As many of you know, I’m passionate about public speaking. If you have ever wanted to attend one of my talks, I have a full [events page on my website](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/events/) with all of my upcoming commitments.

This year alone I’ve given more than 50+ keynotes at some of the biggest conferences, companies and universities in the world.

I’m officially done speaking for 2017 but wanted to give you a quick update about 3 events I’m super excited about in the new year.

### **#1 VaynerExperience is hosting AGENT 2021**

For anyone in AUTO, REAL ESTATE, TRAVEL, or INSURANCE, VaynerMedia is hosting it’s first ever event [**Agent 2021**](https://garyvaynerchuk.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=86038d4417ce1a95af9b5eb09&id=e14fe51f88&e=5a26fdfbc1) down in Miami on January 24th. I’m super excited because this announcement marks a major milestone for VaynerMedia and I under our new experience division, VaynerExperience.

Yesterday’s tools are no longer enough for growing businesses in today’s world. There is a gap between where consumers are spending their time and where marketers are spending their dollars.

Agent2021 is a one-day conference that educates agents and owners on how to use innovation to grow your business. Join me, Ryan Serhant, Tom Ferry, Gillian Morris, Andy Frisella, Beth Clifford, Chris Smith, and many other industry leaders to learn about the tools, platforms, and tactics that can be used to start marketing in the year we live.

I’m also doing a few special deals 😉

### **#2 My 5th Book Crushing It! Releases 1/30/18**

[You can pre-order the book on Amazon now!](https://garyvee.com/crushingitinfo)

Crushing It! is my 5th major book release where I dissect every current major social media platform so that anyone, from a plumber to a professional ice skater, will know exactly how to amplify his or her personal brand on each. I offer both theoretical and tactical advice on how to become the biggest thing on old standbys like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat to audio-centric platforms like Spotify, Soundcloud, iHeartRadio, and iTunes; and other emerging platforms like Musical.ly. For those with more experience, _Crushing It!_ illuminates some little-known nuances and provides innovative tips and clever tweaks proven to enhance more common tried-and-true strategies.

I really want this to be the best guide to building your own path to professional and financial success, but it’s not about getting rich. It’s a blueprint to living life on your own terms.

### **#3 The National Achievers Conference February 1st!** 

The third event is going down in Houston on February 1st. I’ll give you the state of the union on attention, business dynamics, and the digital ecosystem covering our society!!

You will join inspiring, world-leading, home grown and international game-changers, who’ll share the systems we use to turn our own passion into success.

I’ll also be hosting an intimate dinner for 8 individuals. Enjoy a no holds barred conversation on business while you dine on the finest food and wine at the Chef’s Table of a local favorite, 5-star restaurant. This is an exclusive offer you won’t get anywhere else.

On the following night, after the Success Resources Conference, I’m hosting a 20-person strategy session where we’re going to sit down and talk about all things relevant to **_your_** business.

If you ever wanted to have an intimate dinner with me or strategize one-on-one around your business, this is the event for you.

If this interests you at all or if there’s anyone you know that might be up for one of the most epic events of 2018, [make sure to check out the rest of the details here.](https://www.nacconference.com/gary)

*   My advice on how to scale your business and investments
*   And a new copy of my book [_Crushing It!: How Great Entrepreneurs Build Their Business and Influence-and How You Can, Too_](https://garyvee.com/crushingitinfo)

I have had an incredible year and I look forward to an even more exciting 2018! 

Happy holidays,
