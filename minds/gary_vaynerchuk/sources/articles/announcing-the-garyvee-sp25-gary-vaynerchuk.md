# Announcing... The GaryVee SP25 - Gary Vaynerchuk

I’m so fired up to announce my newest sneaker release collaboration with K-Swiss and Shoe Palace!!

For Shoe Palace’s 25th Anniversary, we’re going to be releasing the Shoe Palace x K-Swiss “GaryVee SP25” on December 4th, 2018.

Shoe Palace is a retail company that started off as a small family business, just like Wine Library. They went from one location in the Bay Area to over 160 locations all over the country. Super excited to collaborate with a family business for my next sneaker launch!  

## How to get them

The Shoe Palace x K-Swiss GaryVee SP25 will be mainly available at Shoe Palace’s Palo Alto location (451 University Ave, Palo Alto CA 94301) and online at [ShoePalace.com](https://www.shoepalace.com/) starting 12/4 – with limited quantities going to select locations around the country\* (full list of locations are added below).

## An invitation to my holiday party

I’m also hosting an exclusive, private holiday party in Palo Alto at the Shoe Palace location on December 11th from 6pm – 9pm PST to celebrate the release and end the year with a bang!

We’ll have some fun over food, drinks, and holiday activities. There will also be a live Q&A session with me 😉

Here’s how to get an invite:

Purchase of the GaryVee SP25 from the Palo Alto location will guarantee you entry to the party. Shoe Palace will also be running a raffle for those that purchase online and announcing the winner within 48 hours of launch. The raffle winner will receive airfare and hotel for 2 to attend the event.

Oh yeah … we’ll also be doing some fun stuff for First In Line. [Subscribe here](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/garyvee-first-line/) if you’re not already part of it.

If you have any questions, hit up [@TeamGaryVee](https://twitter.com/teamgaryvee?lang=en) on Twitter.

Can’t wait to see you there!!
