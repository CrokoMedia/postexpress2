# how to start creating content

  
One of the things I get asked about  the most in my life is how to start creating content.  

**Documentation Matters:** 

There is no one size fits all answer to this but what I do want to pound everyone’s skull each time with is to document their life on social media…If you’re a lawyer with five years of experience and you say something I’m seeing in law around IP law and you write four sentences, you make a video, it depends on how you communicate. If you’re an engineer, post about your opinions and observations. If you’re in design, post about your take on the newest trends…document, document, document. It’s important. 

So many of you are so scared of being boo-ed that you never get started. I made thousands of videos before anyone knew who I was or cared about what I did.

As a person who’s done this for decades, I can tell you that it’s not humanly possible to predict what goes viral…but, consistency is in producing more and more content in the expectation of going viral…that’s how you win the game.

You have to keep hitting it consistently until you make that one video or piece of content that puts you on the map. 

**How to Start:**

**Double Dip:**

What I mean when I say I don’t create content for social media is that I document…I document what I do and that itself becomes what I can post on my social media as packages of content. 

For example: small business owners or creators should use being on a podcast to help them produce content… Write a cold email to a small podcast that you know is likely to feature you and strategize and grow together. Use the contents of that clip and spread it across your socials in multiple ways–That’s how you double dip.

**Make Use of Insights and Be Consistent:**

Long before I did shows that were bigger I did tiny shows on YouTube to build up my digital presence. Back then, making clips out of episodes for your socials was not even a thing. Which is why I believe the current world has it even better and can build and build upon that advantage. 

Use the insights and feedback to build your content over time and see what the world does with it. 

**Have the Humility to Start Small:**

Most people underestimate how difficult it is to get to the top of the nuanced space that is content creation and get in their own head about having an attitude about starting small. You can and should have the humility to do small shows and the work ethic to reach out to hundreds of creators to collaborate on your respective work and repurpose the content from the episodes/collab for your own social media.

**Don’t Sleep on Tiktok, Linkedin, and YouTube Shorts:**

Written word or video, one piece of content on LinkedIn or Tiktok where you have no followers right now can change the course of your life because now you have inbound people offering you jobs based on your take on things. The way social media platforms are evolving, every platform is going to follow TikTok’s footsteps because it’s the recipe that works. It works because it’s based on merit.

Meta is going down that direction…Instagram is going to do that too. You’re already seeing that happening with YouTube Shorts, which is why I’ve been saying it for Facebook’s pages as well––starting getting into all of that. You could be the next big thing in your field thanks to that. 

It’s time to give up the allure of aesthetic feed or fears around rejection on social media, the key is to get started and start sharing your story in a way that works for _future you_.
