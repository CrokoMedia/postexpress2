# A Huge Thank You To All My International Volunteers

Hey guys!

Over two years or so, I’ve been working with a lot of great contributors who have been working hard at translating my content to different languages.

I wanted to write this article to bring them some exposure because a) I would love for you guys to do some work with them, and b) I’m eternally grateful to them for helping me expand my reach.

Now, let me introduce May who runs my international strategy 🙂

—

_Enter May:_

Hi everyone, this is May!

I’m a channel manager on Team GaryVee and I support Gary’s international growth through content creation and distribution. Although on the surface it seems like chaos managing Gary’s content in multiple languages, I’m fortunate enough to work with amazing volunteers who dedicate their time and energy to help grow Gary’s presence in their native language. I will be forever amazed by how hard and relentless they work to spread Gary’s message and am beyond honored to call them members of Team GaryVee.

All listed individuals have played a huge role in paving the way for Gary’s international presence. Without their hard work and continuous efforts, we wouldn’t be where we are today. Some are currently active in various positions, and some were active in the past. Nevertheless, Team GaryVee would like to recognize their achievements and dedication with our deepest thank you!
