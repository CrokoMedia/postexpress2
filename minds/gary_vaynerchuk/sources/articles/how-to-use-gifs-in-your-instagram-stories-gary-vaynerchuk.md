# How To Use GIFs in Your Instagram Stories

_You can now add GIFs to your Instagram Stories._

Guys, Instagram just launched an incredible new feature for marketers and storytellers. [They now allow you to use GIF](https://blog.instagram.com/post/170041256272/180123-gif-stickers) [Stickers in your Instagram Stories.](https://blog.instagram.com/post/170041256272/180123-gif-stickers)

### **Take Advantage of Instagram Updates in 2018**

As we continue to watch Instagram and Facebook innovate, it’s important to understand why these companies actually succeed.

A number of social platforms like Vine, Twitter and Myspace, lost their competitive advantage when they lost the ability to rapidly improve and iterate on their product. They became romantic about 6 second video or 140 characters being the only way to communicate and eventually missed out on other opportunities to tell stories in new and interesting ways.

Instagram as a platform and product continues to impress me by adding features like text only stories and the ability to use GIFs inside Instagram Stories by accessing Giphy’s API of over 1 billion images.

As someone who is a practitioner of what I preach, I am always willing to taste, test, try and learn. As an entrepreneur and marketer, It’s important for me to tell you why and how you should be using Instagram Story GIFs.

### **How To Use GIF Stickers In Instagram Stories Using The New Giphy Update**

The second my team and I saw the opportunity we’ve been creating and learning by going all in on producing more custom GIFs for Instagram Stories.  I already have around 20 Instagram Story GIFs that are available to use:

I created a handful of other funny and tactical GIFs and I’m just getting started. 

### **Here’s How to Find and Use Instagram Story GIFs**

If you want to use the GIF stickers in your Instagram Story follow these steps. 

1.  Open Instagram Stories and record a video or take a photo
2.  Click the GIF Sticker Icon
3.  Search @GaryVee 

Then select a GIF and post! Just like anything else, trying something when it’s new equates to underpriced attention. Because I am already making GIFs for Instagram stories, I consistently show up in searches for Entrepreneur, Hustle, Monday, and more.

I really think this has the potential to be used by millions of people inside Instagram’s community.

I love the feature and am going to keep creating more content for Instagram Story GIFs 😉

Here are some of my favorite Instagram Story GIFs you can use now:
