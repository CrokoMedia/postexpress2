# Mark Your Calendars, the Super8 Live Stream Event is Going Down!

Who is ready for the best live stream in book marketing history?  

> On February 23rd, from 10am – 6pm EST for 8 hours I will be holding a live streaming of the SUPER 8 event.

Don’t know what I’m talking about? Watch the video below:

During and only during the Super 8 event, if you buy 8 books and send in your receipt to [Super8@vaynermedia.com](mailto:Super8@vaynermedia.com) you will be entered to **win a 1-hour solo-jam session with me**. I’m currently accepting one hour jam sessions for 1,000 books … in other words you’ll be saving yourself a shit ton of book copies ?.  I will pull from a bucket of all printed out receipts and whose ever receipt I pull will be the lucky winner!

During this insane live stream I will be jamming with all of you, answering questions, having friends and guests come join and generally having the most ridiculous fun we’ve had on a live stream event!

> So there you have it, set your reminder and get your ass in gear, because the Super 8 day is going to blow your face off!!

**What**: Super 8 live stream event

**Where**: EVERY live streaming platform

**When**: February 23rd 10am-6pm EST

**Why**: 8 Copies of the #AskGaryVee Book for a chance to jam solo with me

Check out the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/AskGaryVee-Entrepreneurs-Leadership-Social-Self-Awareness-ebook/dp/B00Z71HW8A/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454551616&sr=1-1&keywords=askgaryvee) and [Barnes & Noble](https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2Faskgaryvee-gary-vaynerchuk%2F1122825557%3Fean%3D9780062273123%26st%3DAFF%262sid%3DHarperCollins%2520Publishers%2520LLC_7252156_NA%26sourceId%3DAFFHarperCollins%2520Publishers%2520LLCM000023&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNETpfd_CExCiysf9vO2TuDVBK9fbQ).

## F.A.Q.s

**Do books have to be purchased in multiples of eight?**

No, but we only count sets of eight to be entered into the drawing. For example, bought 8 books? You get one receipt entered. Bought 25 books? You get entered in thrice. 😉

**Do I have to purchase the books during the live stream event to qualify?**

Nope. If you have purchased books before the event, just send in your receipt.

**Do I have to buy the books from a particular book seller?**

Yes… only receipts from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/AskGaryVee-Entrepreneurs-Leadership-Social-Self-Awareness-ebook/dp/B00Z71HW8A/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454551616&sr=1-1&keywords=askgaryvee) qualify for the event.

**I bought the audio book, does that count?**

Sorry, but only the physical, hard-cover version counts.

**Where do I send my receipts?**

Send them to [Super8@vaynermedia.com](mailto:Super8@vaynermedia.com)!

**Do I have to watch all 8 hours to qualify to win the grand prize?**

No, but you might miss out on some surprise guests and other random prizes…

**What if I live outside of the US? Can I still win?**

Anyone in continental North America qualifies for a trip to New York. If you’re outside of North America, we’ll find a way to meet up. 😉

**When will you pick the winner?**

I will pull the grand-prize winner around the end of the live stream (6:00pm EST).

**Where can I watch the live stream?**

You can watch the stream on my [Facebook Page](https://facebook.com/gary), Periscope (@garyvee), and Meerkat (@garyvee).
