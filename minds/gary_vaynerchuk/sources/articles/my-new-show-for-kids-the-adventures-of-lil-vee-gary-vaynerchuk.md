# My New Show for Kids: "The Adventures of Lil' Vee"

I’ve always believed that “scratching your own itch” is the best business model.

When I was a little kid, I watched Saturday morning cartoons, and I loved them. I loved the excitement of looking forward to Saturdays to watch those shows.

I’m excited to announce the [first episode of “The Adventures of Lil’ Vee”](https://youtu.be/TL5jL8NU94E), which is exactly the cartoon I would have watched from 1981 – 1988 as a kid who loved selling stuff.

This announcement is for anyone who has young children in their family, or teachers with a classroom of young kids.

Over the years, I’ve gotten a lot of emails and messages from parents and teachers who wish they could share my content more.

The biggest thing I’m trying to do through my content is show people how it’s possible to be a successful entrepreneur while being a good, kind person at the same time. I’m trying to put positivity, empathy, kindness, and optimism on a pedestal for the next generation.

I’m aware that my content isn’t always the most conducive to kids because of my cursing, but I really want to be able to share my message with them in a relevant and contextual way … aka an animated YouTube kids series.

The show is inspired by the sorts of things I did as a kid (like selling lemonade and baseball cards), but contextualized for the modern world.

For example… [in the first episode](https://garyvee.com/lilvee), Lil’ Vee gets an idea to make slime and sell it in school. He goes through the process of figuring out how to make something that people like and sell it to other people.

The Adventures of Lil’ Vee is built to entertain kids first, open their eyes up to what’s possible in business (especially if they’re showing some early signs of entrepreneurial talent), and show them how empathy and kindness can be cool.

The first episode is a pilot to get as much feedback as possible, dying to hear your thoughts 🙂 Watch, and [then hit me up on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/garyvee)
