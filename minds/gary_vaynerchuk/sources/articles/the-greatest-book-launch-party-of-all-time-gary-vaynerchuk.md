# The Greatest Book Launch Party of All Time!

VaynerNation,

As some of you know, my next book ‘[Crushing It!](https://garyvee.com/crushingitinfo)’ is launching on January 30th, 2018 and this time around I’m doing something BIG and different! February 3rd, on Super Bowl weekend in Minnesota where the big game is being held, I’m going to throw the biggest book launch ever. Yup, that’s right. I’m throwing a book launch party during all the Super Bowl madness, so everyone in Minnesota.. Everyone in middle America.. Everyone flying in for the game MUST stop by 😉

I am going to shut down.. And I mean dominate the weekend of parties and tailgating and events with my “[Crushing It!](https://garyvee.com/crushingitinfo)” book launch!

[About the book:](https://garyvee.com/crushingitinfo)

Crushing It! is my 5th major book release where I dissect every current major social media platform so that anyone, from a plumber to a professional ice skater, will know exactly how to amplify his or her personal brand on each. I offer both theoretical and tactical advice on how to become the biggest thing on old standbys like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat to audio-centric platforms like Spotify, Soundcloud, iHeartRadio, and iTunes; and other emerging platforms like Musical.ly. For those with more experience, _Crushing It!_ illuminates some little-known nuances and provides innovative tips and clever tweaks proven to enhance more common tried-and-true strategies.

I really want this to be the best guide to building your own path to professional and financial success, but it’s not about getting rich. It’s a blueprint to living life on your own terms.

Please join me for this epic event and learn how to keep Crushing It in your life and work!

You can [pre-order the book here!](https://garyvee.com/crushingitbook)

I really hope to see you there!

Xoxox,

Gary
