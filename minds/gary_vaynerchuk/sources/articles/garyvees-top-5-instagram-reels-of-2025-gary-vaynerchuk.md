# GaryVee's Top 5 Instagram Reels of 2025!

With the help of my team, we’ve compiled the top five pieces of content across each of my social platforms this year.

As many of you know, I don’t define “top” content according to vanity metrics.. This isn’t necessarily about which posts received the most likes or comments. Instead, these are the core messages we hope — and think — brought you guys the most value this year.

That being said, keep reading to see my top five Instagram Reels of 2025 – watch these to kick off your 2026!

## “I know one day I’m gonna be somebody…”

99% of you who see this are wonderful and great people .. please start loving yourself ❤️

## If you’re 36, you’re a f\*cking child

Listen to the end … promise … listen deeply .. it matters … once you get “it” … your life gets better … 36 year olds .. this is for you ❤️❤️❤️✅

## How old are you? You’re f\*cking 23 years old!

For the youngsters …. Let this video click in!!!

## I fire every single person that is not a good human being…

This one is for the people trying to build a long term business … too many of you will make the mistake I talk about at the end of this video .. please pass this onto a boss that you think needs to hear 👂 this and definitely pass it on to a owner that you care for to make sure they have this “down.”

## Do you know who’s about to make a f\*ck load of money?

The world we live in today is leading to an electrician movement that is more reminiscent to the past like in the 1920’s and then again in the 1960’s… go figure ;). Ai 🤖 will impact many jobs and many will be positively affected – so if you have a teenager and they like working with their hands – share this with them.

Thank you so much for your attention this year and every year. I’m so grateful for every one of you. Happy new year!
