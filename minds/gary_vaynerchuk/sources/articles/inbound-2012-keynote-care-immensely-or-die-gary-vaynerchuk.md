# Inbound 2012 Keynote: Care Immensely or Die!

My best keynote in years! How about doing a random act of kindness for a customer you already have, and not one who just unsubscribed?

How about auditing your time, finding the dumb shit you’re doing, and reallocating even the smallest portion of it toward caring about your end consumer? The acquisition has been mapped. Now it’s all up to us as brands to start acting like humans again.
