# Why Reading This Article Won't Help You Be a Better Entrepreneur

I love that I have fans. I love that all of you consume my content and learn from me and get inspired. But the truth is, I don’t care about _how many_ of you are subscribed to my YouTube channel or [_how many_](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/numbers-dont-matter-influence-does/) of you actually read these articles. That’s not the point of why I put out all this content.

The point, in all honesty, is that I want to leave an impact. I want the legacy of being an all time great businessman and inspire thousands of you to go out there and do the same. I want to kick your butt into gear. I want you to DO.

I’m not over the fact that everyone seems to have an insane lack of patience and a lack of understanding of what it takes to be successful. There are so many of you out there with the same exact questions about how to be an entrepreneur or how to run a successful business or how to do x, y, and z. And so many times I have given you the same answer: put out content; build a great product; test and try it all; use your data; use your intuition; test and learn, test and learn, test and learn. It takes time, talent, and skill.

However, what’s most frustrating is that I’m giving you so many of these answers yet most of you still aren’t actually doing it.

Have a great product and need to bring awareness to potential customers? You can do it through content marketing. You can do it through advertising. You can do it by going to the Chamber of Commerce. You can do it by cold calling every single business in town and getting their support. There are so many ways to do it.

But one way not to do it is by watching all my videos or reading Seth Godin’s books and just pondering and white-boarding all day about what your next move is going to be. Too many of you just read and consume and make pretend and talk about how “you’re gonna do this” or “you’re gonna do that.” **Lack of action is not the way to do it.**

Personally, when I have an idea, I execute on it right away. I like to constantly stay in motion. I’m always changing my products and changing my game. I’ll redo my pitch deck for VaynerMedia because I’ve got different ideas on how to sell it better. And if I don’t? Oh well. I don’t fear losing—I love to lose. I get over the fact that I might lose the micro-battle, because in the end, the fact that I did it is what’s going to get me to win the war.

I understand that I’m an extreme. I don’t read anything (which probably isn’t the best). But how many books from these “experts” do you need to read before you can actually do something? You can only read so much and at some point, you just have to do.

> Stop being a student, and start being an entrepreneur.

I don’t care if you “like” or share this article. What I want you to do is actually take action and do something for yourself. There are so many of you who come up to me after a talk I’ve given and whisper in my ear: “You’ve changed my life.” That’s what I get off on and that’s what I want to see more of.
