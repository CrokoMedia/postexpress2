# GaryVee's Top 5 TikToks of 2025!

With the help of my team, we’ve compiled the top five pieces of content across each of my social platforms this year.

As many of you know, I don’t define “top” content according to vanity metrics.. This isn’t necessarily about which posts received the most likes or comments. Instead, these are the core messages we hope — and think — brought you guys the most value this year.

That being said, keep reading to see my top five TikToks of 2025 – watch these to kick off your 2026!

## How old are you? You’re f\*cking 23 years old

I know I push patience so much, but I promise it’s a trait many more should lean into. When you have it, more of what you want happens.

## If you’re broke…

Remember… you’re capable. Craigslist, eBay, Whatnot… let’s get flipping, y’all. People are listing free sh\*t on Facebook and Craigslist all day. Grab it, flip it, repeat.

## “I know one day I’m gonna be somebody…”

You’re somebody NOW. The moment you decide to accept your shortcomings and bet entirely on your strengths, things will change. Trust me.

> I want people to learn to be at peace with themselves, to understand what they can offer, because everyone’s got something. The key, however, is learning how to find it. Self-awareness can help you do that. The moment you decide to accept your shortcomings and bet entirely on your strengths, things will change. Trust me.

## I fire every single person that is not a good human being…

If you’re the CEO of a company, it’s imperative that you go audit every single employee in your company and figure out which ones make the other employees miserable. It doesn’t matter if it’s your number one salesperson, your best developer, or even your co-founder. Cancer spreads.

> What a lot of people don’t understand is, speed in business comes from great internal culture. The biggest things that will make your company go fast is 1) continuity and 2) lack of politics. That’s why it doesn’t matter how “great” an employee’s numbers are if he or she makes all the other employees miserable. If they constantly spread negativity or drag other employees down, it doesn’t matter to me how good they are on paper. If you’re the CEO of a company, it’s imperative that you go audit every single employee in your company, and figure out which ones make the other employees miserable. It doesn’t matter if it’s your number one salesperson, your best developer, or even your co-founder. Cancer spreads. And if you have people in your company that are cancerous, you have to get rid of them no matter how much revenue they bring in.
