# Why is Raising Money More Celebrated than Making Money?

I’m concerned, a little bit, with the culture of celebrating the fund-raise. My dad taught me that when you borrow money, It’s the worst day of your life.

Just now, we didn’t clap for [Red Rover](https://redroverhq.com/), because they didn’t raise 6 trillion dollars, but I was sitting here like “Good stuff!” (I just filtered myself).

What I’m looking for are people who are not caught up in the excitement. Even though I’m a hype man myself, I like the practicality of it all. People who understand how to turn a profit. At the end of the day, this is still a business, right? So I’m looking for the real practical knowledge of how to actually make money, not necessarily raise it.
