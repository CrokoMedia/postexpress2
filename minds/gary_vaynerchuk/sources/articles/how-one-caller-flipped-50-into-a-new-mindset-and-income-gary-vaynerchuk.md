# How One Caller Flipped $50 Into A New Mindset and Income

Starting from nothing is a common theme on Tea With GaryVee, but this first-hand account might be the one to inspire you to start flipping. That’s because Shawn started his journey with just $50 and a thought that garage sales and thrift stores might be the answer.

**Shawn**: Gary, you’ve changed my life man; both financially and mentally.  Last June, I started watching your garage sale videos and I have a story that I think will impact everyone listening. 

\[I saw your [garage sale flip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-Omll7wVYk) and\] I was like, fuck, I can do that shit. Although, at that time, I only had 50 dollars in my bank account. I had 50 dollars, student debt, and a part time job.  \[Still\], I was working and trying to make extra money by flipping things on the side. 

**Gary:** So, wait, you have 50 bucks, you see the video…and it’s like, fuck. You see the video and you think: that’s not investing in Facebook, that’s not starting VaynerMedia, that’s something _I_ can do.

**Shawn:** Yeah, exactly.

**Gary:** I don’t want to get emotional…but the single reason I did that show was because of what you just said. Right now, the only thing I want, the only thing that drives me, is to help other people get happy because I’m so happy. I think the world is so abundant…and I came from dirt too bro. 

**Shawn:** Same bro.

**Gary:** I wasn’t given shit. I figured it out with humility and work ethic and education–trash talk is education, by the way. \[I’m interrupting you\]–keep going!

**Shawn**: So, I started going to garage sales and thrift stores. I would buy things for a dollar, then I would sell for two or three dollars. 

**Gary:** Where? Craigslist? Facebook Marketplace? \[I’m asking because\] two or three dollars on Ebay, with fees and shipping, isn’t much.

**Shawn:** Well, it was mainly Ebay.

**Gary**: So, you were learning. Even if you made fifty cents, you were learning.

**Shawn:** Facts. Plus, it built up my \[seller\] feedback, which helped promote the other stuff I would sell on Ebay. 

I really think anyone could do what I did since I only had 50 dollars to my name when I started. I was still working a part time job. I’m also a college student; if I can do it, anyone can.

This past school year, I was working three part-time jobs, as a full-time student. So, I’m living proof that the “Oh, I don’t have time” excuse is just wrong.

**Gary:** Everyone has time. People … tell me they don’t have time _as they watch me_. It’s like, why are you watching me if you don’t have time? If I was a kid, I wouldn’t be watching Gary Vee, I would be out doing. You have to do!

So, what was your first breakthrough?

**Shawn:** I found a little Einstein’s play-thing. And it was complete; it had all the pieces and everything. I found it for $5 at a thrift store. Then I sold it for $100 on eBay. From there, I kept learning and learning … then, this last month, I made $10,000 in sales. I grew $50 to $10,000.

The thing is, anyone can do this.

**Gary**: I know.
