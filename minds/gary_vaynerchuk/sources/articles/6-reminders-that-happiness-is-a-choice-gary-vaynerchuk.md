# 6 Reminders That Happiness is a Choice

To me, life is pretty simple. There’s things you can control and others you can’t. Everything boils down to your actions and your mindset but there’s just far too many of you continuously caught up that just don’t see it that way.

This is my attempt to clear things up once and for all.

## **People’s Opinions:**

Just don’t matter.

Most people get caught up in other people’s opinions because growing up that’s all they knew. They either had parents who made them insecure, were bullied in school, or had a girlfriend or boyfriend who instilled that venom in them. Me? I don’t give a shit. No one’s bias or uncontextualized thoughts are going to bring me down. Nobody can stop me from going where I want to go and so as long as I know my intentions are good and pure, you can keep those opinions to yourself.

Fuck what anybody else thinks. You’ve got one life. Are you really going to allow someone else, who likely has far more insecurities than you, bring you down from a stupid comment they made on social? I didn’t think so. So please stop dwelling on what others have to say. Nobody cares. This is _your_ life. Do something about it.

## **Expectations:**

Zero.

Nothing I do for anybody else comes with strings attached. I do what I do because selfishly, it makes me feel good. But do I expect anyone to return the favor? Never. I fully understand that anything I want in this world is on me. Period. The second you start relying on others to deliver what you want, you lose. This is on you, my friends. Live a life with zero expectations and you’ll never get hurt. Live a life knowing that your happiness and success are fully reliant on your actions and mindset, and you will win. Got it?

## **Perspective:**

No matter how bad you think you have it, there’s somebody that has it far worse. And of course, there’s people in this world that are going through some horrific shit, but if you’re reading this article right now, I’m almost certain you don’t fall into that category, so please stop complaining. If you’re truly unhappy, then figure it the fuck out. Remove money from the equation and understand what makes you tick. Go all in on that and unlock the happiness you seek. Take advantage of all the resources we have out our disposal and put in the fucking work to make something happen. You have to be practical and you have to work your ass off to get there, but if it’s going to make you truly happy, then why would you consider anything else?

## **Hard Work:**

The only thing we can control.

You may not be the smartest, the fastest, or the most well-rounded, but you have the same hours in the day as anybody else. You really want it that bad? Then you’ll put in the hours to get there. And if for whatever reason you don’t get what you initially set out to get, I promise you will still be better off for it. You’ll either stumble on something new that you didn’t initially think of, or, you’ll realize that what you originally wanted wasn’t actually what was going to make you happy. But there’s only one way to find out. WORK.

## **Gratitude:**

Be grateful. You’re here. It’s another day.

All the information in the world is at your fingertips. You want to learn something new? Cool. Go do it. You want to reach out to that person you admire? Great. Go hit them up _directly._ You want to escape from your reality and be entertained. Have at it. We’re living through the greatest era of all time and for whatever reason, there’s just far too many of you wasting time and complaining with your head down.

You know why I’m so grateful? Because I understand my history. I know what the generations before me went through and I fully understand how good we have it today. My grandparents were thrown in jail because they were Jewish men in Soviet Russia. And you think that you have it bad? Let’s get serious.

I get to wake up every day and do exactly what I love because I leverage the tools we’re _all_ lucky enough to have in order to get there. I’m taking full advantage of this time we have and so many of you are acting like you have three lives to live.

Look, you have the same playing field that I do. You just have to understand yourself and your ambitions and put in the work to get to where you want to be. It’s that simple.

## **Positivity:**

The greatest form of currency we have. If you understand everything I mentioned above then there’s no reason not to be positive, right? The power is in your hands. And you know what happens when you’re positive? It begins to rub off on those around you and suddenly your world gets that much better. [Everybody has ‘something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJej09jbUoI&list=PLfA33-E9P7FDVxSf9B5HSOaoM-_SEcc0N&index=4)’ so before you judge or spew hate, realize that that we’re all living the same life, just in different bodies. We’re all the same, doing our best to navigate the world that we’ve been thrown into. And so, if there’s one thing I can entirely get rid of, it’s the negativity that so many of us default to. It’s only a reflection of you and your inner turmoil, so if you really want to leave a mark on this world, think before you leave that negative comment or talk behind that person’s back. Spread the love because karma is fucking practical. Do good and good will come back to you. Make positivity louder and begin to see the results.
