# Meta Launches Threads: Here’s What You Need to Know

[Threads](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-an-instagram-app/id6446901002) has officially launched! 

[![GaryVee talking about threads ](https://garyvaynerchuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-06-at-1.39.42-PM-188x300.png)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CuVcHZogmY7/)

I’ve been playing with the beta for a few days now before it launched last night to the public. All of you should immediately go and sign up for your Threads account. 

The biggest thing I’ve been seeing is people saying this is a “Twitter killer.” It’s not a “Twitter killer.” The world is about “and” not “or” – both apps can exist at the same time. 

The main point of this article is to tell you, whether or not you like the idea of the Threads app, or Meta in general, go sign up. Figure it out and try new things. It’s incredibly important to try new things whether you end up liking it or not is completely irrelevant. Get curious about new platforms and how it works. 

The key when there are new platforms that come out is you “tasting” it by trying it out. This isn’t a headline of “Threads vs Twitter” – as they’ll both exist. This is more about the question of “Can you go on there and use your Instagram community to create a new environment?”

For a lot of you missed the very early Twitter boom, or don’t understand how Twitter works, and this is your opportunity to try this new app out. 

Don’t get into the debate of whether it’s going to beat Twitter or not – whether it’s “a fad” or not – get into the mindset of trying new shit and trying to build your audience and bring value. 

Also, keep in mind that this platform comes with a community from day 1 which matters and will help a lot of you.

Here’s Team GaryVee who will give some more context around Threads and what it is: 

## **How To Use Threads**

First, let’s talk about what Threads actually is.

Threads is a text-based sharing social media app from Meta that is connected directly to Instagram.

This means that you can sign-up for Threads directly through your existing Instagram account and start following everyone you currently follow on Instagram. 

By having it connected through Instagram, it allows you to connect and start conversation with your current followers and build your community in a new, text-based manner previously kept on other apps like Twitter.

Threads also allows links, photos, carousels, and videos up to 5 minutes in length so you can share any additional media that you want to start a conversation around.

## **Engage With The Community On Threads**

Threads is all about text-based sharing and community conversation. 

This means that whereas Instagram is more about sharing photos and videos to provide value, educate, entertain, or sell a product/service, Threads hammers home text-based conversations designed to promote discussion around a certain topic or idea.

The main goal here is to create a “thread” of conversation within your community around a topic that pertains to you and your brand, company, etc. 

You can also have friendly debates around topics that can stir up a good discussion within your community. This truly is designed to be a “conversation-starting” social media app.

Get on the the app & get curious!
