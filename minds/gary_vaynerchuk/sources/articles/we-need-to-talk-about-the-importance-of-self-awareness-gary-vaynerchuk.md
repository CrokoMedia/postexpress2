# We Need to Talk About the Importance of Self-Awareness

There is something that is rarely talked about in the business world and I want to start building more attention for it.

That thing is self-awareness.

I’m upset that the narrative these days is that everyone needs to be number one, own a company, be in charge. A lot of people are going to lose that way.

Self-awareness allows people to recognize what things they do best so they can then go hard on those aspects of their life. It also helps you accept your weaknesses.

What works for one person doesn’t work for everyone. I want people to learn to be at peace with themselves, to understand what they can offer, because everyone’s got something. The key, however, is learning how to find it.

Self-awareness can help you do that.

Self-awareness is being able to accept your weaknesses while focusing all of your attention on your strengths.

The moment you decide to accept your shortcomings and bet entirely on your strengths, things will change. Trust me.
