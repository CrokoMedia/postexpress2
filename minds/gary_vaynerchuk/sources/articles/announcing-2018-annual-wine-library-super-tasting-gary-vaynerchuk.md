# Announcing 2018 Annual Wine Library Super Tasting

Hey guys 🙂  
  
I’m really excited to once again announce the annual Wine Library Super Tasting event!It’s an annual event Wine Library has been hosting yearly for 17 years now, and this year’s is going to be EPIC. 

There will be over 700 wines from around the world, plus amazing gourmet cheeses, oysters and more.

And just like last year, I’ll be there in-person the whole time mingling with everyone 😉

I’ll also be throwing it down for an exclusive wine tasting and business Q&A session, so if you’d like to spend some more time with me and ask me questions, make sure to get the special “[Wine Tasting and Business Q&A](https://winelibrary.com/others/108383-exclusive-blind-wine-tasting-and-business-q-a-with-garyvee)” ticket. You’ll get to take part in an exclusive private seminar and taste 4 super high end wines in a blind tasting format, and spend 30 minutes doing Q&A.

It’s a must-attend event if you’re in the tri-state area, and a great road trip opportunity if you aren’t!
