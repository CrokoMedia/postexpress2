# Tea with GaryVee is Back... on Whatnot!

Hey everybody. 

For those of you who haven’t heard, Tea with GaryVee is BACK ☕️! This time, [join me on live streaming platform, Whatnot, on Wednesday, October 23rd at 9AM EST](http://garyvee.com/whatnot) for a jam-packed hour of entrepreneurial advice. I’ll be taking questions from my community all about business, so if you’re interested in possibly joining me on the stream to ask your question LIVE, be sure to [submit a question here](http://garyvee.com/questions). 

As a quick reminder, Tea with GaryVee is a live stream show I started back in 2020 in order to chat with and answer questions from my community in real time. So, grab your tea, your coffee, your water or whatever else you drink and [tune in, 9AM EST sharp!](http://garyvee.com/whatnot) 

If your question is chosen, my team will get in touch with you, but please scroll down and check out the end of this blog for more details! 

That being said, I wanted to take this opportunity to talk a little bit about the Whatnot platform. If you’ve been paying attention to my socials, you may have noticed that I’ve been pumped about live streaming on Whatnot lately, and like I always say, watch what I’m doing, not what I’m saying. I want to take this opportunity to explain what I’m doing on Whatnot and how you can potentially implement some of these practices into your own brand or business-building endeavors.

## WHY WHATNOT?

**Live Shopping Is Coming!**

Whatnot is a social marketplace where you can watch me live and be a part of my live auctions! Some of you may have tuned in for some of the VeeFriends livestreams, which are a lot of fun — they’re a cool, new way to jam with our community, and you might even catch some epic giveaways or other surprise & delight opportunities. 

But this is also something you can apply to your own business or brand.

Live e-commerce shopping has been a huge topic in China for almost a decade now, but I don’t think that people understand that we’re on the tipping point of live shopping in the U.S. You’ve heard of Instagram Shop and TikTok Shop, but I can just sense that we’re going to be talking about live shopping in 2025 the way we talk about A.I. now, and the way we talked about blockchain in 2023. Trust me, live shopping and platforms like Whatnot are going to become a major focus next year.

So, whether you’re looking for new ways to engage with your community or venturing into [consumer packaged goods](https://garyvaynerchuk.com/two-things-im-focused-on-for-2024/), Whatnot is a platform you should be exploring. Especially for those of you with an international community or consumer-base, Whatnot is a game-changer because it allows you to sell to a global audience. If you’re from outside of the United States, you can buy seamlessly through the app and it’ll send your purchase directly to you. Whatnot also features the ability to bring special guests into the stream virtually.

Want to see Whatnot in action? [Join me for my next livestream](http://garyvee.com/whatnot), Tea with GaryVee Ep. 61, on Wednesday 10/23 at 9AM EST. By the way, [you can submit a question here for the chance to join me live on the stream](https://garyvee.com/questions).

That being said, I’ll let my team take over from here. [Download this quick guide](https://garyvaynerchuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/101824_Whatnot_OneSheeter_v5.pdf) to learn how to sign up for Whatnot and how to be ready if you’re selected to join me LIVE during Tea with GaryVee!
