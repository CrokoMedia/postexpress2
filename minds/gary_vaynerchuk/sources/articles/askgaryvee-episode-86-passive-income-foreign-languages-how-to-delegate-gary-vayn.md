The best piece of advice i can give on delegating is very much up in the clouds, but you know me: I’m a clouds and dirt guy. 😉 I’m pretty great at delegating, and I’ll tell you the middle one rule to delegating well: recognize that 99.9% of things don’t mean shit. If you actually think it’s not that important, it becomes a hell of a lot easier to let someone else do it. If you recognize that someone else’s 7.7 point skills are completely acceptable for a task in place of your 10 point skills, do it. It’s all about humility. Ego is the issue with delegation. Even though I have a ton of ego, I have a boatload more of humility than you think.
