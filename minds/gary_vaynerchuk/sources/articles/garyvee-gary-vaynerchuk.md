> ”I day trade attention and build businesses.

Outside of his businesses, “GaryVee” has spent the last decade pioneering the practice of building a personal brand online through his series of original [pillar shows](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRkoJxjV-NUNKMVXiDnjo9uFrGr7VqcBJ2rI8on8ERR5EQGfoG_q4bjEn6wNcD-wkAg3ijEgj7Dsllw/pub?start=true&loop=true&delayms=10000&slide=id.g39e2578ab1_0_0).

He documents his life and career through his YouTube vlog series, “DailyVee” and “WeeklyVee,” builds community and offers advice through Q&A shows, “AskGaryVee” and “Tea with GaryVee,” conducts value-packed interviews with other leaders and experts in the “GaryVee Video Experience” and “GaryVee Audio Experience,” gives hot takes on a variety of different topics in culture in “Overrated/Underrated,” and teaches people how to make extra cash on the weekends through garage sale flipping in “Trash Talk.”
