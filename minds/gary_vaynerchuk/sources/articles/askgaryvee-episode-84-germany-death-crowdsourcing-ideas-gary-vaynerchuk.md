#QOTD: What are you doing this weekend?  
  
#TIMESTAMPS  
[1:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ZkWDQKSH4&index=1&list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs#) – Do you get a lot of quality ideas when you crowdsource a question? Do you crowdsource ideas more to engage with your audience or to get serious ideas?  
[3:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ZkWDQKSH4&index=1&list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs#) – I find myself preferring to create content and engaging online vs going out, shopping or partying. I’ve never been a party person before, but I wondering if I’m creating a sort of addiction to the internet. How much of your time is creating content vs making appearances and attending social things like parties?  
[6:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ZkWDQKSH4&index=1&list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs#) – What are your thoughts on social Media Marketing in other countries? I’m from Germany and Meerkat is nothing more than a cute Animal. And even Twitter is not as dominant than in the US. Would you recomment to still go there and wait? And to sit there and hope?  
[8:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ZkWDQKSH4&index=1&list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs#) – We have a great customer experience in store, how do we take that online?  
[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ZkWDQKSH4&index=1&list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs#) – If you were to tragically die today, how well would VaynerMedia do long term without its CEO? Have you been satisfied with Wine Library’s performance since leaving to focus on VM?
