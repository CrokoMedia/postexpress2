# 5 winter wine cocktails for easy drinking!

We only have 22 days left in 2020–now is the perfect time to relax with your loved ones. Relaxing doesn’t have to be fancy. If this year has taught us anything, it’s how to be creative with what you have. With that in mind, here are 5 recipes for cocktails that feature a special ingredient that’s almost always on hand–wine!

Because we’re far past the days of apple cider and eggnog, let’s end the year right. Keep reading to learn how to make the best winter (wine) cocktails around. 

#### 1\. Red Wine Hot Chocolate

Can you name a better pairing than wine and chocolate? We couldn’t think of one either. This recipe from [Wholefully.com](https://wholefully.com/red-wine-hot-chocolate/) is just the right amount of sweet, fruity, and decadent. Try it with a [2018, Royal Prince Napa Cabernet Sauvignon](https://winelibrary.com/wines/cabernet-sauvignon/2018-royal-prince-napa-cabernet-sauvignon-121123) from Wine Library.

#### 2\. Mulled Wine

This one’s a classic. If you haven’t heard of it before, Mulled Wine is a spiced holiday beverage typically served hot. But the full, complex flavor also works well chilled or slightly below room temperature. You can make it with this 2017, [Elodia El Manzano Estate Malbec](https://winelibrary.com/wines/malbec/2017-elodia-el-manzano-estate-malbec-118190) from Wine Library. Try this recipe from [Delish](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a23364385/mulled-wine-recipe/) when you want to elevate your celebrate-the-holidays-from-home game.

#### 3\. The fireside cocktail

If you’re ready to kick things up a notch, check out this comforting treat from [WineMag](https://www.winemag.com/recipe/the-fireside-cocktail/). Instead of a classic Merlot, switch to a more interesting blend like the [2015, Yokayo Buteo Rockpile Cab](https://winelibrary.com/wines/cabernet-sauvignon/2015-yokayo-buteo-rockpile-cab-120627) that’s slightly sweet with more intense fruit flavors. This cocktail is easy to improvise and customize to your taste, so it’s perfect after a long day of working from home or if you’re lucky enough to entertain friends for the holidays. Just don’t forget to add a piece of basil or mint before you sip, if you’re trying to be fancy. 

#### 4\. Hawaiian Spritzer 

Maybe you can’t go to the tropics this year, but you can make this cocktail (and that’s kind of close). This recipe comes from [WineMag.com](https://www.winemag.com/recipe/hawaiian-spritzer/) and it’s the perfect blend of bright, tropical flavors and intense holiday spices. Try it with a [2019, Chateau Lacombe Cadiot Bordeaux Supérieur](https://winelibrary.com/wines/merlot/2019-chateau-lacombe-cadiot-bordeaux-superieur-120136)–a blend that’s bound to take the guesswork out of picking the right spices to give this cocktail that special holiday feel. 

#### 5\. Dripping Springs Seltzer 

This is another fire recipe from [WineMag.com](https://www.winemag.com/recipe/dripping-springs-spritzer/?utm_source=Wine%20Enthusiast.com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=1295253_WEM%20Top%20Shelf%20May%2023&utm_content=spritzer&dm_i=219S,RRF9,3DTKJ,1XPCQ,1). Switching from the reds, this recipe calls for a light, sunny, wine spritzer. Try this [Cruset Blanc De Blancs](https://winelibrary.com/wines/airen/cruset-blanc-de-blancs-118558) from Wine Library that’s bright, fruity, and light. Similar to the Hawaiian Spritzer it’s best when sipped in the sun and thinking of the tropics.
