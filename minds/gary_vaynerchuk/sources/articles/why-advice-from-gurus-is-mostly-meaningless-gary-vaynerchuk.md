# Why Advice from Gurus is Mostly Meaningless

A lot of people have asked me throughout the years how I am able to work so hard all day and night. Don’t I get tired? Exhausted? Where does the drive come from?

For me, it all comes down to loving it.

It’s the truth. The only thing keeping me going day in and day out (and night in and night out) is that I love it. I love all of this. I love doing [my show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs). I love flying all over the country. I love getting in from a flight at 1am and then waking up for 6am basketball and an 8am meeting.

But I am the first to say that my advice isn’t for everyone. And I love it when people talk about the ways in which they operate differently from me.

Because the truth is, I don’t expect everyone to be like me. Not at all. In fact, you should be focusing on what works for you. I think people ask successful entrepreneurs questions like “What does a day look like for you?” because they think they might hold some secret to success. Some overarching wisdom that will change everything.

We don’t.

The only advice I can give you is audit yourself and figure out what makes you work the hardest.

I [wrote an article a while back](https://medium.com/@garyvee/being-a-morning-person-doesnt-make-you-more-successful-277921a29d00) that I love because to me, it speaks to this very thing. In it, I talked about why you shouldn’t try to make yourself a morning person. It’s bullshit. Just because someone wakes up earlier doesn’t mean they are any more productive.

**It’s not about how much you sleep. It’s what you do while you’re awake.**

Don’t force yourself to wake up early. Don’t force yourself to skip lunch. Don’t force yourself to be like me and take a hundred meetings a day.

Figure out what makes _you_ most successful. I am always happy to share my wisdom with you guys, because for some of you, it might actually work. And for tactful advice, I’m even happier to help (just gonna mention Facebook dark posts one more time). But never assume I expect all of you to be just like me.

If you’re hustling, good shit will happen. Period. What the hustle looks like varies. All I ask for is that you work hard and fast.

_What do you think? Would love to hear your thoughts. 🙂_
