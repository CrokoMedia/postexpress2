# Storytelling in 2013 - Gary Vaynerchuk

If you’ve been following my keynotes for the last few years, I think you should really watch this one to see how much things have changed. WE ARE AT SCALE.

  
I’m not talking about the future anymore. I’m not talking about what things are going to be like. We need to be telling our stories right now with the platforms that are here right now.

Don’t be the person who refuses to play like the year it actually is. Whether it’s a 140 character story or a six-second one, or even one what disappears forever after 10 seconds. We need to be storytelling for now!
