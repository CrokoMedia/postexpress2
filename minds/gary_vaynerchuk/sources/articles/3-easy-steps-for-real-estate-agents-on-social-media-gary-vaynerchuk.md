A few times on the [#AskGaryVee Show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs), I’ve received questions from real estate agents, or given answers that I think could apply to that industry. Here are three quick steps to get you started.

## 1\. Gain buyers trust

Get on Twitter and engage with people authentically. Don’t try to make the sell right away. Have a conversation. Check out the full answer [here in an article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130829164107-10486099-13-tweets-a-real-estate-agent-should-have-answered-not-me?trk=mp-reader-card) I wrote on this exact topic.

## 2\. Get out of the industry norms

FIRST) Your industry is not boring. SECOND) Don’t spend time in your world. Go beyond it. Listen to me talk about it more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8lGg2TA-T0#t=5m22s).

## 3\. Make interesting content

Review local schools, interview residents, talk about the best cafes in the neighborhood; create a story around the places you are trying to sell, and get people feeling sentimental towards them. I talked about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6M3PsghaI4#t=5m43s).
