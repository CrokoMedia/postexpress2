# Are You Following Me on Apple News?

[I’m on Apple News!](https://apple.news/A5rqRLamATyCDPhydG_UuPA)

I wanted to share a quick update that I’m super excited about. All of my blog content that I post on [Garyvaynerchuk.com](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/blog) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@garyvee) is now available on Apple News. It’s an incredibly simple user experience that I think a lot of you will enjoy. The only way to receive updates about my content is to subscribe 😉 I made a short video to show you how:

Following my appearance on Apple’s first original show [Planet of The Apps](https://www.planetoftheapps.com/en-us), I’m finding more ways to get involved in Apple’s ecosystem.

I also just released [my first sticker pack,](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/garyveestickerpack/id1240377331?mt=8) on the Apple App store.

**Thanks for reading! 🙂 Can’t wait to see you on Apple News!**
