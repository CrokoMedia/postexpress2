# The K-Swiss GaryVee 001 “Crushing It!” Colorway is Coming!

  
As many of you know, I released my first ever pair of sneakers in collaboration with [K-Swiss on November 14th, 2017.](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/garyvee-001-002-sneakers/) 

Despite all of the doubt, VaynerNation showed up and the shoe was a success. I remember going into full customer support mode when K-Swiss’s website broke down at midnight during the launch 😉

I’m grateful to say that GaryVee 001 and 002’s sold out. The sneakers were always a win-win. It was either something I could laugh at in 40 years with my friends for trying to do a shoe, or a moment to remember as my first real entrepreneur/sneaker collaboration that would become part of my legacy. 

I did an epic pre-release at [ComplexCon to celebrate the launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDY6Gfg258) and followed up with a shoe signing at [Footaction in NY.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TyYWEnXrOo)

### **And now I’m back!**

With my [#1 New York Times Bestselling book, Crushing It!](https://garyvee.com/Crushingit) hitting the list today, I’m dropping a limited edition Crushing It! shoe as an official companion 😉

I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart who read the book. Nothing matters more to me than the consumption of this mission, which has been a decade’s long journey since my first book Crush It! put me on the map in 2009. Whether you purchased the book or stole a copy from bitTorrent .. my hope is that these principles will show you the blueprint around what’s worked for me and other great entrepreneurs along the way.

Because of the success of the launch, and the success of my first two original sneakers, the team at K-Swiss and I thought it was the perfect opportunity to do something fun for my community by releasing a custom Crushing It! colorway sold at popups in LA, Toronto and London. Not only is this a celebration of the my 5th book, but really all of my books and the journey that got me here. Barney Waters, Brand President of K-Swiss and the whole team  have been so supportive of this project that it only felt right to give you one more!

Here’s a quote from **Barney about why we did the shoe:** 

_At K-Swiss we believe that young people’s aspirations have changed, from wanting to be athletes to wanting to be CEO’s and entrepreneurs.  Gary is the voice of this movement, and when the GaryVee K-Swiss sneakers sold out immediately, it really validated our theory.  So now we’re doubling down in 2018, with the new ‘Crushing It’ shoe as just the beginning._

_Gary is known for breaking new ground.  Not only was he the first entrepreneur to have a signature sneaker, but this might well be the first sneaker commemorating a New York Times best-selling book._

_When we launched the GaryVee 001 and 002 they were US only, and we heard the most complaints from Gary’s fans in Canada and the UK.  To try and make it up to them, we made sure that Toronto and London were two of the locations you can get this new Crushing It shoe._

_We’re delighted to celebrate Gary’s latest accomplishment, the launch of Crushing It, with a special colorway of the GaryVee 001 sneaker.  There are only a limited number of pairs so people will have to decide whether to wear them or display them._ 

**This shoe is limited to 600 pairs only!**

I’m doing something very different by having 3 Popups where you will have to enter a raffle at each to win a ticket to the exclusive meet and greet as well as the opportunity to purchase 1 of the 600 pairs of shoes. The Popups will be in LA, Toronto and London. 

The 150 or so people that win each location’s raffle will be able to hang out with me and get an exclusive 2Hour Q&A on all things business, entrepreneurship and the book.

### **Here’s the description of the new shoe:**

### **The** **K-Swiss x Gary Vee “Crushing It!” Gen-K Icon Knit**

Presented in a rich black, vibrant yellow and white accent colorway, the K-Swiss x GaryVee “Crushing It!” Gen-K Icon Knit is a sneaker that demands notice and celebrates the launch of the 5th addition to the bestselling authors’ library. This lightweight sneaker features a flexible, flat knit upper complemented by contrast yellow leather 5 stripes on the medial side. Premium details like a supple leather heel counter with loop, knit tongue with GaryVee signature branding and waxed laces elevate the look or a second set of round laces to keep it sporty.  The upper compliments the signature Gen-K EVA outsole that provides supreme comfort and a dynamic look. The outsole bottom reveals a surprise detail, a nod to the book’s launch date, highlighting the importance of celebrating personal accomplishments.

I strategically chose London and Toronto to give back to my community who had issues with my first sneaker release. Each pop-up will be a full on Crushing It! experience where you can hang out and get first dibs on this hyper limited shoe.

This is a super special experience for me and one I could have never imagined preparing for the release of this book. I hope that it’s unique and something you haven’t seen before.  

This shoe and this book is dedicated to all the people who are visionary enough to recognize the enormous opportunities we’ve been given in this new digital age, and who are brave enough to demand and seek out happiness not only in their life, but also in their work.
