# Here's Where UNHAPPINESS Begins: A Gary Vaynerchuk Original Film

Today I’m bringing you my latest original short film all about [accountability](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/road-to-twelve-and-a-half-accountability/). Introducing, Here’s Where UNHAPPINESS Begins…

We need to start putting accountability on a pedestal. I think that if you take responsibility for everything (without beating yourself up, of course), then you are also the person with the power to change things around.

When you hold yourself accountable, it leads to solutions; it helps you maintain a position of control instead of being a victim. So many of you reading this right now — in this exact second — are unhappy because you’re pointing fingers instead of thumbs and feeling a lack of control.

The lack of accountability leads to so much worse. If we can prop up accountability instead of shying away from it, we will be happier.

I hope you watch and enjoy. Watch it twice to let it really sink in 😉
