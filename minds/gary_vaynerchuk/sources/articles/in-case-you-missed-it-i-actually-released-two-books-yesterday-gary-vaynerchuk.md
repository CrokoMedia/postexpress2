# In Case You Missed It, I Actually Released Two Books Yesterday

## Why the #AskGaryVee Audiobook is a Whole New Book

When it comes to reading out loud, I am atrocious. Really, truly terrible.

For whatever reason, I can’t seem to get it down.

If you give me a piece of paper to read from, or any kind of notes, I freeze up. I can’t do it. It becomes impossible for me to perform. A while back I had to read a commercial on a radio show before being the guest, and they gave me a piece of paper with everything I had to say. I completely botched it. I kept messing up. Finally, one of the guys on the radio show suggested I lose the paper and just talk.

That did the trick.

In fact, one of the big shifts I’ve made in 2015 is to schedule a lot of 5 and 7 minute meetings with my staff instead of them just emailing me because I don’t read fast enough for the value of my time. It is better for me to hear it in person, aloud.

Even reading my daughter a bedtime story feels a bit intimidating. I’m still a bit hesitant. If I had to just come up with the greatest story off the top of my head, I would be calm. But hand me a copy of Goodnight Moon and I’m a mess.

So as you might imagine, when it came time to record the audiobook for [my newest book #AskGaryVee](https://www.amazon.com/AskGaryVee-Entrepreneurs-Leadership-Social-Self-Awareness-ebook/dp/B00Z71HW8A), things weren’t looking great. I was nervous about it. I hadn’t done an audiobook [for my last book](https://www.amazon.com/Jab-Right-Hook-Story-Social/dp/006227306X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1457460023&sr=1-1&keywords=jab+jab+jab+right+hook) so it had been a while. I was nervous.

So what did I do?

I just answered the questions all over again.

Because the format of the #AskGaryVee book is Q&A, it was so easy for me to hear the question and then answer right on the spot. No reading necessary.

That’s why the audiobook is a whole new book. My answers remain the same, but the examples I give, the anecdotes, the way I explain things, the format in which I answer: all that changed.

And, I’m gonna be honest, some of the answers probably changed to. It will be interesting to see who can point out places I say different things. 🙂

Not sold on it? Check out some snippets from the audiobook in this video here, and make sure to download [a copy if you’re intrigued](https://www.amazon.com/AskGaryVee-Entrepreneurs-Leadership-Social-Self-Awareness/dp/B01A5UKWRU/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=):
