# Being the Bigger Person, Content Strategy and Advice for Startup Businesses: Tea with GaryVee 9/26 Recap

Super excited to be back doing Tea with GaryVee with the community! Today’s episode was packed with lots tactical value and great conversations with nine guests — from scaling a startup business to content strategy and making the most of your marketing budget (and much, much more)! 

For those who don’t know, Tea with GaryVee is a Q&A show I started back during the height of the pandemic as a way to set aside some time to go deep and bring some real value to all of you. 

Here are some highlights from today’s episode on Tuesday, 9/26 – as always, hope you enjoy!
