# What is Clubhouse app, and why does it matter?

Let’s talk about [Clubhouse app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clubhouse-drop-in-audio-chat/id1503133294).

The app is the beginning of a wildly underrated, emerging, social media platform. Why is it underrated? Because most people don’t know about it yet. While many of you might already know about Clubhouse, in the scheme of 300 million plus Americans and 7.5 billion people on earth, very few do.

The audio resurgence that I’ve been talking about for years continues as Clubhouse becomes a very popular place for many people to have conversations around a bunch of topics. It is an app many of you should keep an eye on. I’m very fond of it; it replicates real life. What if any number of people got together at a dinner table and just talked? Then, what if everyone got to listen to it? 

It makes sense why it’s working. I love the audio platform…I think, a year from today, a lot more people will be on it. I’ve been using the app for several months now, and I’m excited to share some of my thoughts and answer some of your questions. 

## What is Clubhouse?

As I mentioned above, Clubhouse is an audio based, social media app. However, it’s notable for its big name users and for allowing these users to connect with their fans, critics, or whoever else. This is important because in a post-Covid world many casual networking events, and informal hangouts, have disappeared. So, it’s easy to see why the app has been compared to everything from Twitter to LinkedIn, and even Soho House. 

In Clubhouse, users create “Rooms” where they are responsible to curate discussions around a variety of topics, from _How to effectively network during Covid_ to _Is Kevin Hart Funny?_ Or, they have the option to join someone else’s room. Then, users can either speak on a topic or listen to everyone else’s opinion. It’s been compared to being at a house party, conference, or just walking around outside. I thought it was a great new medium to host this morning’s Tea With GaryVee Q&A. After looking at some of your comments on Twitter, I think you guys agree.

Users can follow other users who they feel curate interesting discussions or have interesting opinions. All conversations are wiped clean after the session is over, rather than being saved or archived, so if you want to hear someone’s session you have to actively participate. Finally, you have the option to receive a notification if someone you follow has curated a room.

## How to get a Clubhouse invite?

It’s no secret that Clubhouse is kind of exclusive, it’s invite only. The app is still in beta and while they’re working through issues and fixing bugs, a select number of people have been given invitations to test features and further explore the app. Initially, invitations were limited to notable people in the tech, entertainment, and media industry. However, each person who receives an invite also receives invitations to share with anyone they feel would find value from the experience. So, you don’t have to be an influencer, or know someone who is, to test out the space.

So, how do you get a Clubhouse invite? Look around your circle, notice who’s a member of a creative or tech-focused industry, and ask. If you have an extra invite, drop a comment below.

## Is Clubhouse only for Apple?

Right now, Clubhouse is only available on iOS. However, the company plans to create an Android friendly version of the app as soon as May 2021. 

## How does Clubhouse work?

Here’s the fun part. Let’s talk about the layout. After you’ve poked around in your network and secured an invitation, you have two options. The app’s algorithm will provide you with a list of people you may be interested in following. After you choose to follow someone on the list, or not, you can sit in a room or curate your own. Again, it really is just humans discussing topics and listening to one another.

That’s it. Yes, some users may be celebrities or influencers, but ultimately, the app is another way for people to stay connected. You may end up catching the attention of a CEO or exec who likes to hear your idea–and maybe you won’t. But, regardless of the outcome, if your intent is to be authentic, provide value, and empathetically listen to others…you’re gonna have a lot of fun. Talking when you know, and not being afraid to say something AND staying quiet are the keys to clubhouse.
