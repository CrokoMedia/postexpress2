# Build Your Solo Empire in 2026! Join the GaryVee x Stan Challenge

## Why I’m endorsing Stan

Stan founder [John Hu](https://www.instagram.com/jayhoovy/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=3a09e457-e14c-456b-b0b5-aecb8d797267) recently asked me why I invested in his company, and I gave him a very simple answer: I invested in his company because I invest in good companies. I think the bigger question is, why have I endorsed his company to the point of putting my face on [this challenge](http://garyvee.com/stan)?–which is something I don’t often do.

The reality is, I know when there’s a tool that comes along that changes the paradigm, and Stan is one of those tools. I truly believe that what John has built through Stan is the most needed extra element–lightweight, frictionless tech infrastructure–for creators and entrepreneurs to be able to monetize their attention and audiences. This is a company that has really caught my attention because it actually is the tool that was built for the people that read my books like _Crush It!_ and _Crushing It!_ and have started the process of making things happen, and now they just need that next step.

This challenge will help you take that step.

## The 2025 GaryVee x Stan Challenge: Everything You Need To Know

I know when I see something that matters. [This challenge](https://garyvee.com/stan) that I’m doing with Stan is important and it’s important you know what you’ll get from it. So, here is everything you need to know:

### **What is Stan?**

Stan is an incredible infrastructure tech stack for the creator/entrepreneur and the entrepreneur/creator economy. Simply speaking, it’s a digital storefront that you can quickly set up on your own, even if you’re horrible at tech.

### **What do you get when you join the challenge?**

1 – First and foremost, you’ll get Stan… and you’ll get it at a discount. Normally, it’s a ridiculously low $29 a month, but I worked it out with John so you’re able to pay just $300 for the whole year.

2 – Next, you’ll get access to me. I thought to myself, how do I make this really, over-the-top, ridiculously valuable? And so the other thing you’ll get with the launch of this challenge is eight weeks of one-hour calls with me and the other challenge participants. That’s right. For eight straight weeks, starting in early October, I will be meeting with you on Zoom calls to talk about how you actually use Stan to your advantage. Sure, you can set up a Stan store in five minutes, piece of cake… but how do you get traffic there? How do you drive to your business? That’s what we’re going to focus on in these eight weeks of calls.

3 – Finally, the top 10 earners in the [GaryVee x Stan Challenge](https://garyvee.com/stan) will also get flown to my New York City headquarters for a full day session with me and other VaynerX leaders in January!

### **Bonus!**

As if all of that wasn’t enough, there’s more… Five additional participants who make just $555 with their Stan stores during the eight weeks of this challenge will also be flown out to join the top 10 earners in New York City.
