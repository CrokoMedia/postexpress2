# Deciding How to Pick Between Your Two Passions

Discovering your passion in life is a tremendous gift. Knowing what you’re good at and how you can use it to live your life is a great feeling, and not something everyone figures out.

But maybe you feel like there are two things you really want to pursue, and you’re not sure which direction to take.

Is it possible to tackle two passions at once, without half assing one? Can you do two things equally well, or do you have to make a decision?

A lot of people might tell you that you need to pick one.

But not necessarily. There are so many creative ways to combine ideas, and the world of social media has only made it easier to bring two different worlds together. In a way, it gives you an advantage because you may be the only person in that world. I like the quote: “If you want to be an anomaly, you have to act like one.” Could you become the first person to combine two things that have never been combined before?

For example, I did a popular wine show back in the day ([maybe you’ve heard of it](https://www.youtube.com/user/WineLibraryTV)). For me, I picked one thing and stuck with it. That worked just fine. But, I also love wrestling and football. And while the idea didn’t come to me at the time, what if I had only filmed episodes at football games or wrestling matches?

So this is the challenge I put to you: can you combine your two passions? It’s okay to even get a little weird here. What is the most insane way you could combine them? Work back from there. Or, maybe not. Maybe go for it.

Social has created a world in which the niche is rising to the top. With Facebook’s targeting capabilities, apps like Vine creating stars every day and Instagram’s hashtag culture, the more niche, the more engaged audience you will have. Use those things to your advantage.

Bottom line: If you can combine your passions ([Wuzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wuzzles) them, as I said on [my YouTube show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs)), you may pop and become an anomaly and have disproportionate success. Most likely, you won’t. And your financial upside is most likely predicated on picking one and going all in, most likely.

_But_…consider happiness as a larger factor than money. Are you truly having trouble picking one? You may just have more happiness mixing the two than you would if you went all in on one.

_Have you ever had to pick between two passions? What did you do? Would love to hear your story._
