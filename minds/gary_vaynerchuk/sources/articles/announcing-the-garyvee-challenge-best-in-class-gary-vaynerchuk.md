# Announcing The GaryVee Challenge "Best In Class"

As many of you may know, near the end of 2019, I launched the #GaryVeeChallenge to push more of you to go through the [free 270-page free slide deck I put out](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/how-to-create-64-pieces-of-content-in-a-day/).

These were the rules:

1.  Participants referred to my [content deck on how to create 64 pieces of content in one day.](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/how-to-create-64-pieces-of-content-in-a-day/)
2.  They chose the tactics that fit their style, content, and social platforms.
3.  They put out content.
4.  And they added the hashtag **#GaryVeeChallenge** to their posts.

Here are some of the “best in class” and “honorable mentions” from the contest:

## **Best In Class**

These were people who really caught my attention with their content – either with their creativity, persistence, message, or all of the above.

These three will be flown out for an ~hour long group podcast session with me! Hit them up and show them love!

> The [#garyveechallenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/garyveechallenge?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) has been impactful this month — (part 1 of 2) I always hesitated posting too much content—thinking I would come across as spammy and I randomly get friend/trolls who question my work ethic because I draw and paint a lot
