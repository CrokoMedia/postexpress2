# DailyVee 012: The Chef That Grew Up

I don’t want to be a motivational speaker. I want to be a business man first and foremost. And the chef that grew up with the grandma who cooks tends to always beat the chef that went to the culinary institute.

It was an interesting day for us on ‪#‎DailyVee‬ 012. CNBC was following me around for an episode of a new show they are filming so there is a gap but we talk book strategy with my team and I finish my audiobook recording.
