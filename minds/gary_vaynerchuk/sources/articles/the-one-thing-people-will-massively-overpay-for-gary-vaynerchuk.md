# The One Thing People Will Massively Overpay For

I don’t think [Uber](https://www.uber.com/), [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/?af=43720035&c=A_TC%3Dta2zq9t9w9%26G_MT%3De%26G_CR%3D100808697856%26G_N%3Dg%26G_K%3Dairbnb.%26G_P%3D%26G_D%3Dc&gclid=CKae9qOhjMwCFcNahgoduo8PwA&dclid=CN2o-6OhjMwCFRAIDAodO1EEvQ), and [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/) are anomalies in the way a lot of people tend to view them. I think they’re just a preview of what’s to come.

The biggest reason I got excited about Uber years ago, was because I realized that it wasn’t about transportation. This is about a company that sells me back time.

When it comes to business, time is your number one asset. In order of magnitude, we as a society literally care about the health our loved ones, money, and then **time**. It’s number three on that list. And if you really think about it, it’s stunning to watch people’s behaviors around the things they most value.

I had literally boycotted LA for four years when I was starting VaynerMedia because I didn’t want to have to hassle with the time it took to rent a car and get around. It was just too much of an investment. I valued my time so much that I didn’t even consider visiting. I love time. Uber gave me that time back.

> Time is everyone’s number one asset.

We love time so much we don’t even think about it. Think about the last time your phone or your computer was a hundredth of a second slower than what you’re used to on WiFi and how much you cursed and got pissed off. That’s how much we like and crave time. It’s a huge theme that will play itself out and should be really understood by those of you who are looking for a place to play with new businesses.

Being able to buy and sell back time is what some of the most successful startups over the last 3 years have done. They capitalize on our craving to get back the time we have to spend on the things we don’t want to do. If you’re thinking in start-up mode, and looking for an inspirational seed as a starting point, I highly recommend thinking about time. People will massively overpay for it. And if you can figure out that trade off, you’re putting your business in a good position.
