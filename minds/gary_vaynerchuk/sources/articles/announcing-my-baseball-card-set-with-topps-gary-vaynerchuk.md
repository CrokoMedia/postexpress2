# Announcing My Baseball Card Set With Topps!

I’ve teamed up with Topps to create my very own baseball card set! 

It’s so fun for me to have this partnership – the 11-year-old me would not believe that this would have ever happened.

Topps DIRECT360 features designs, themes, and players that I felt reflect the concept of “living your hobby” – something you know I’m super passionate about if you follow my content. 

There’s a little countdown timer [on this page](https://www.topps.com/cards-collectibles/curated-sets/topps-x-garyvee.html) and once it runs out, the cards will be gone! Here are the details: 

Collector’s Edition is guaranteed to include one autograph. That autograph could be mine or a player included in the [autograph checklist](https://www.topps.com/amfile/file/download/file_id/299/product_id/229538/). Base set is $20, no autograph. Both sets include 41 total cards and have the opportunity to win a GaryVee 360 Access Experience card. Those include:

*   2019 Topps Baseball Series 2 Box Autographed By Me
*   Group Dinner in NYC with Me
*   One-on-One Five minute video call with Me
*   Join Me in a Suite at an MLB Game in NYC
*   Collection of GaryVee Books Autographed by Me
