# 4 New Year’s Resolutions You Should Make to Improve Your Career

As the year comes to a close, people are naturally going to be talking about their New Year’s resolutions. But want to know what I think you should really be focusing on in 2016? Here are four ways to further your career.

## 1\. Become a Deep Practitioner in Something

Whether you do it for your business, or just for yourself as a hobby, practice something on a deep level. One of the reasons my agency VaynerMedia has grown to be such a leader in our industry is because I myself use social media every single day. I understand the trigger points that make things successful in a creative world, and I understand the context of the platforms like Snapchat and Instagram. There hasn’t been a single one of my 135k tweets that I haven’t sent myself.

So, whether it’s Instagram or Snapchat or something emerging like [musical.ly](https://musical.ly/), become a practitioner. Stop judging what people are doing or saying it and do it. Engage.

## 2\. Audit Your 7pm to 2am

Back in the days of my first big keynotes, and my first book Crush It, I began to get obsessed with the time period between 7pm and 2am. I do not think that there is a more practical way to bring happiness and joy to your life, whether it’s financial or creative, than to really audit your 7pm to 2am.

I am quite practical about things; it might not be what people expect from me, but I am. That time between when the traditional work day ends and when you fall asleep is the white space for so many people to do great things around businesses. Whether that’s advancing your career by staying in the office late, or going home and building out your cooking blog or SoundCloud account, use that time more wisely in 2016.

## 3\. Practice Self-Awareness

I’ve been on this kick publicly for the last 18 months and, personally, my entire life. I believe self-awareness is the greatest gift a person can have. I tried to tackle this year [how to find self-awareness](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/4-ways-to-find-out-what-your-strengths-are/); out of this entire article, if you make this one your 2016 priority, you will grow happier and more successful. I promise that.

## 4\. Eliminate Complaining

Looking at the negative, seeing the glass as half empty, and complaining are the absolute biggest wastes of time a human being can engage in. I highly recommend, whether it is through therapy or just kicking the habit, cut your complaining in half till you are no longer used to just doing it without thinking. Systematically. Post-it notes. Listening to positive podcasts. Doing mediation. Whatever helps you do less complaining. It truly is one of the biggest things that can stand in the way of success, both professionally and personally. I would be remiss not to have it on this list.
