# DailyVee 004: Always Adjusting, Always

Yesterday was an interesting day. I was supposed to record the audiobook, but we got thrown a curveball. So what do you do? You hustle and adjust. I’m always adjusting.

So while the beginning of the day started out a little rough, it got better from there. I took a bunch of meetings with Vayner employees, filmed an episode of #AskGaryVee, and had a great jam session with the team that night. Check it out below:
