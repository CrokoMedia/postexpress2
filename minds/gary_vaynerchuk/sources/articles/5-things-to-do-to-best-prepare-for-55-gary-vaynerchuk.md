# 5 Things To Do To Best Prepare for 5/5

Hey everybody. Before we jump into the article, I invite you all to check out my NFT project, [VEEFRIENDS](https://www.veefriends.com/), which launched on Tuesday May 11th! My article, [How to Buy Your First VeeFriends](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/how-to-buy-your-first-veefriends/), will walk you through the concept behind the project as well as how to make a purchase. I also encourage you to join the [Discord community](https://www.discord.gg/veefriends) – just a fun place to connect, hang out and ask your questions on all things VeeFriends. Hope to meet you there!

What’s happening on May 5, 2021? Yes, it’s Cinco de Mayo, but it’s also the day I launch my very own NFT project. This article will take you through the 5 simple steps you should take to prepare. 

If you already know what’s up and you’re still not ready…what are you waiting for?

**5/5 – it’s going DOWN.** 

This project is the culmination of my life’s work, tailor-made with my OG community in mind! There will be a combination of purchasable tokens and free giveaways to benefit as many of you as possible. This is bigger than collectible art — this is me giving back real value for the long-term. 

> I agree there’s a lot of poor projects .. it’s why I am motivated .. I want to create a blueprint that others can follow to bring wayyyyy more value to their audience and community and build long term ❤️♥️💙 [https://t.co/ifocFY8OFy](https://t.co/ifocFY8OFy)

To participate, I’m encouraging you to educate yourself on NFTs or non-fungible tokens, and then get yourself set up to be ready for the launch. Team GaryVee and I have already prepared a few valuable, in-depth resources — linked at the end of this article — but here’s everything you need to do in 5 easy steps: 

There are tons of cryptocurrency wallet options, but I think [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) will be the easiest option for the masses to get involved. MetaMask is an Ethereum wallet available as a desktop extension or mobile app; super simple and FREE to set up. Run and get it done, ASAP! 🏃‍♂️💨

## **2\. Pick an Exchange**

Boom. You have your wallet…now you need to pick a cryptocurrency exchange that allows you to buy Ethereum, aka ETH. I recommend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), Gemini or Binance. Go make an account! I’ll wait…

Please note that it is also possible to purchase ETH directly through MetaMask using a debit card. This is done via a third-party service called Wyre which you can access within MetaMask, however, this option comes with geographical restrictions. For example, Wyre is not currently supported in some states including Connecticut, Hawaii, North Carolina, New Hampshire, New York, Virginia and Vermont — [see a full list here](https://support.sendwyre.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055233754-Geographic-Restrictions-). 

For this reason, I recommend purchasing your ETH through an exchange like Coinbase. 

## **3\. Be Aware of Transfer Delays and Limits**

I’ve recommended Coinbase as a convenient and user-friendly exchange. Please note that Coinbase offers several different methods of payment. See the guide below:

[from Coinbase](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/add-a-payment-method/payment-methods-for-us-customers)

As you can see, debit card and PayPal transactions are instant, however, they limit the amounts of crypto you can work with. I’m suggesting everyone get as much ETH as possible, but starting with at least 1 ETH is a good bet to cover a purchase plus gas fees. For this reason, you might want to go with a bank account or wire transfer for your payment method. These options allow you to move larger quantities, but be warned…this route comes with delays. 

🚨 **Important Note** 🚨 

If you wait until the last minute, you likely won’t be able to move your ETH in time for the project launch! Bank transfers can take a minimum of 5 days. That being said, you can reduce transfer delays by choosing to wire money directly from your bank to your Coinbase wallet. [Check out these wire instructions](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/add-a-payment-method/payment-methods-for-us-customers#bank-wire) from Coinbase. Then, simply transfer your ETH from Coinbase to your MetaMask non-custodial wallet. 

Don’t get caught slipping — make your account and purchase your ETH now.

## **4\. Buy ETH**

The time has come. You’re now ready and equipped to buy ETH. Why ETH? Ethereum is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, and the currency you’ll need to make purchases from my NFT project — or any others. Again, I’m suggesting that everyone get 1 ETH in their wallet, but also understand that you should never invest more than you can afford to lose. 

Lastly, once you’ve purchased your ETH on Coinbase or another exchange, you’ll need to transfer it over into your new MetaMask wallet. You can also connect your Ledger or Trezor hardware wallets to your MetaMask account for extra secure storage.

Still lost on NFTs, wallets or why the hell you should even care? If this is you, don’t worry! I’ve got you covered. Check out these resources the team and I have cooked up in the past few weeks — [What is NFT? Non-fungible Token Guide](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-is-nft-non-fungible-token-guide/) will teach you what NFTs are and give you some perspective on why I’m so excited for them to change the relationship between culture and technology as we know it. [How to Make a Cryptocurrency or NFT Wallet](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/how-to-make-a-cryptocurrency-or-nft-wallet/) will give you an overview of how crypto wallets work and the different types, plus get you all set up with a functioning MetaMask wallet! Finally, [4 Steps to Make Sure You Have Ethereum in Your Wallet](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/4-steps-to-make-sure-you-have-eth-in-your-wallet/) will walk you through buying ETH via Coinbase and transferring it safely to your MetaMask. 

Save this, share this, make a checklist out of it! I hope this article clears things up and gets you ready for my drop on 5/5. If you found it valuable, please don’t hesitate to share on your favorite platforms — I want everyone to win from this.
