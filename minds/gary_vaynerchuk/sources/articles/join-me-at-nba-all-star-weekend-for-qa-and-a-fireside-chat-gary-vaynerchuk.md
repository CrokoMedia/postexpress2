# Join me at NBA All-Star Weekend for Q&A and a Fireside Chat

I’m so excited to be heading to Salt Lake City for NBA All-Star weekend February 17th – 19th, 2023!

Here’s what’s going down: 

*   From 11am – 3:15pm MST on the 18th, I’ll be doing a “Q&A booth” at NBA Crossover (a multi-day interactive fan event during All-Star weekend, with player appearances, live performances, and more)
*   I’ll also be doing a 1:1 conversation with Ryan Smith, Co-founder and Executive Chairman of Qualtrics and owner of the Utah Jazz starting at 3:30pm MST, for about 45 minutes. 

Where it will be held: 

*   Salt Palace Convention Center, very close to Vivint Arena where the official All-Star weekend events (like the All-Star game, the Slam Dunk contest, etc) will be played
*   Address: 100 S W Temple St, Salt Lake City, UT 84101 

You can get tickets [here](https://nbaevents.nba.com/crossover) ([general admission for NBA Crossover](https://nbaevents.nba.com/crossover) is $20 for children, $40 for adults). This will give you access to the event and my Q&A booth to ask a question or anything you want my POV on! 

**If you enter the code GaryVee or GaryVee30 at checkout, you’ll get a 30% discount on the ticket.** The first 30 people who use either of these promo codes will get a guaranteed seat at my 1 on 1 chat with Jazz owner Ryan Smith 😉

[The ticket](https://nbaevents.nba.com/crossover) also gets you access to explore the event itself – there will be plenty of activities for people of all ages at NBA Crossover such as music performances, interactive experiences with current and former players, and more. Again, the ticket doesn’t just get you access to my Q&A booth, it gets you access to the NBA crossover event! 

Hope to see you there! Hit me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/garyvee) if you’re going 🙂
