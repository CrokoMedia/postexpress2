# Announcing New VeeFriends Plush & Figure Collectibles | A VeeFriends x Macy’s x Toys“R”Us Collaboration

Hey everybody. Today’s blog is a quick recap of a very special announcement that went down this past Tuesday. This one is very special to me, and I’m incredibly humbled to be able to share it with all of you. 

Introducing VeeFriends plushies and collectible figurines, a limited edition collection with Macy’s and Toys“R”Us [now available for pre-order](https://garyvee.com/VeeFriendsXMacys).

The VeeFriends world is expanding, and it already makes me emotional just thinking about what this means for me and my family.
