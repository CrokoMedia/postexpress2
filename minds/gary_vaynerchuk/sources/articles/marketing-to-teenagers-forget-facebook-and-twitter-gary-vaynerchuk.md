# Marketing to Teenagers? Forget Facebook and Twitter

I just want to make a statement to help marketers out there. It’s a definitive statement, so get ready.

If you are targeting 13-20 year-olds I just want to clarify it for you right now. The **only** things they give a crap about for storytelling platforms are [Instagram](https://instagram.com/garyvee/), [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/add/Garyvee) and Vine. This is not a Facebook/Twitter conversation for that demo. So you’re **just learning** about Facebook and Twitter and it’s already passing you by.

Understand what’s going on there if you’re trying to reach them. See more [here](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/the-snap-generation-a-guide-to-snapchats-history/).
