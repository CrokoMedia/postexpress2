VaynerNation,

I’m super pumped about the release of my new book ‘[Crushing It!: How Great Entrepreneurs Build Their Business and Influence-and How You Can, Too’](https://garyvee.com/CrushingitBN) which comes out January 30th, 2018!

I’m doing everything I can to spread the word and wanted to do something extra special for those that are interested in pre-ordering the book. So with that, I’m going to host a private brunch for 7 people [who buy 350 copies or more from Barnes and Noble](https://garyvee.com/CrushingitBN) and send a receipt to **BrunchWithGary@VaynerMedia.com** 

So that’s for 7 people and 7 people only – BUT – I’m also giving away 1 ticket to the brunch through a raffle drawing for those who buy 10 copies or more [from Barnes and Noble and email their receipt!](https://garyvee.com/CrushingitBN)

The brunch will be happening in NYC on Monday, March 26th (The location will be announced to the attendees) in order to have an intimate 1:1 conversation and Q&A with me to talk about literally whatever you want 😉

Here’s a little bit more about [Crushing It!](https://garyvee.com/CrushingitBN)

Crushing It! is my 5th major book release where I dissect every current major social media platform so that anyone, from a plumber to a professional ice skater, will know exactly how to amplify his or her personal brand on each. I offer both theoretical and tactical advice on how to become the biggest thing on old standbys like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat, to audio-centric platforms like Spotify, Soundcloud, iHeartRadio, and iTunes. For those with more experience, _Crushing It!_ illuminates some little-known nuances and provides innovative tips and clever tweaks proven to enhance more common tried-and-true strategies.

> I got a review copy from Harper Collins. Finished reading it last week.

> Loved it. I’ve recommended it to several friends and family members. I’m convinced you don’t need to be an entrepreneur to find the value in the book.

I’m super proud of this book which features real stories from other entrepreneurs like Lewis Howes, Andy Frisella, Rich Roll, Amy Schmittauer, Shonduras, Lauren Evarts, Brittany Xavier, Pat Flynn, John Lee Dumas, Jared Polin and others who have all applied the tools of building a powerful personal brand to build real businesses.
