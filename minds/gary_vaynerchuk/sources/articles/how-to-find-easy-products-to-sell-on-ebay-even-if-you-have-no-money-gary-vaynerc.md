# How to Find Easy Products to Sell on eBay (even if you have no money)

In the early part of 2017, I created the “[2017 Flip Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_8StGEegc)” to push people to sell products on sites like eBay for profit.   

So many of you complain about not having money to start a business, invest in ads, or build your personal brand. But at the same time, you have things laying around the house that you could sell online.

You could take the time you spend watching House of Cards or Game of Thrones, and use it to find out what products are worth on eBay. You could out what your clothes are worth. Find out what your old electronics are worth. Find out what toys are worth.

And you could use that data to start selling products you already have, flip stuff from thrift stores, or [sell stuff from the “free” section of Craigslist.](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/the-ultimate-flip-how-to-find-free-stuff-to-sell-on-facebook-marketplace-craigslist-and-ebay/)

[In one of my earlier DailyVee episodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwhP754Cqw0), I drove to a thrift store in New Jersey with my brother-in-law Justin Novello, and showed you how we buy and sell stuff from garage sales. We’ve been doing this for years.

And even though it’s 2018, [the flip game is still more real than ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8uzd1y8eAo).

So I want to eliminate _every_ excuse people have for not getting started. 

Today, Justin will show you how to start selling online 😉

**Hi, I’m Justin!**

I work on influencer partnerships on Team Gary at VaynerMedia. I’ve worked with Gary for 14 years at Wine Library, and I’m a big fan of the flip game 🙂  

Before you can buy and sell stuff on eBay, you have to have a sense for what price you can sell your products for. The first part of this article will help you figure that out, the second part will show you how to use that data to start flipping on eBay. 

## **Step 1: Filter for “sold listings” in search**

If you want to see what a product is worth, start by searching the name in eBay search.

For example, you could search something like “Hulk hogan action figure”,  scroll down, and hit “sold items.”

When you select “sold items”, eBay will sometimes automatically check the “completed items” box.

“Completed items” refers to auctions that have ended for that search — whether they sold or didn’t sell.   

You can uncheck this box to only see items that have actually been sold. Or leave it checked to also see patterns on what didn’t sell.

## **Step 2: Sort by price range**

On the results that show for “sold listings”, you can sort by price to see what products are selling for.

If you searched Hulk Hogan action figures, you’ll see there are a bunch of vintage ones that are selling for nearly $1000 (if you sort by “highest price”).

Same thing applies to limited edition products you can buy online.  For example, people have flipped Gary’s “Clouds and Dirt” sneakers for $150-$200+:

You can do the same for products you find at thrift stores, garage sales, or sites like AliBaba.

I also get a ton of emails, DMs, and questions from people asking me what specific products they should flip. People want to know what stuff sells, what stuff doesn’t, a and how they can make the most possible money by picking the right products. 

My honest answer is… everything sells. You can make money selling mugs, selling t-shirts, or just about anything else. The only caveat is, you need to do your homework and research in any given space. There are always nuances — for example, a specific style of Matchbox cars might sell more than others. A specific type of action figure might sell for 2-3x the price of the others.

But if you’re reading this article in 2019… I do have one piece of advice about a product that has a really good shot of for a profit: 

The GaryVee SP25 sneaker. 

You can see the shoe selling for double the retail price on eBay already:

![](https://garyvaynerchuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-01-at-3.33.47-PM-700x530.png)

The shoe is retailing for about $100 at physical store locations across California. And some of them are selling for $200 on eBay. As the sneaker gets more and more limited in quantity (and eventually sells out), it’s just going to raise the price that much more.

## **How to flip products on eBay in 2019 (for free)**

Once you’ve started selling stuff around the house, you can start flipping products from the internet.

But I can already hear the excuses popping up:

“How much will these products cost?”

“I don’t have any money.” 

For a while, we’ve had to pander to these responses because it’s hard to find a way to get products without investing money up front.

But recently, Gary found a different way.

Here’s how you can make $1000 from zero:

**1\. Navigate to the “free” section on Craigslist**

There’s a “free” section on the homepage of Craigslist. Navigate over to that. 

**2. Find a product**

There are dozens of valuable things people out are giving away for free to get rid of them — things like chairs, beds, tables, and more.

**3\. Find out what it’s worth on eBay**

Go through the steps above to see what similar products are selling for on eBay.

**4\. List it and wait until it sells**

List it on eBay for the price that similar products have been selling for.

The free stuff you get on Craigslist are usually big items that people want to get rid of, so you can either list it for “local pick up only” or charge extra for shipping.

**5\. Once it’s sold, give it to the person who bought it.**

Either by shipping it to them (if they paid extra for shipping), dropping it off to them, or having them come pick it up from you.

That’s it.

The internet has created so many ridiculous arbitrage opportunities. This is just one of them. Pick stuff up for free on Craigslist, list on a site like eBay, sell it, and make an extra few hundred bucks a week 😉
