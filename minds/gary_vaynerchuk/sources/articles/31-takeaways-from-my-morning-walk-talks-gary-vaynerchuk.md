# 31 Takeaways from my Morning Walk Talks

If you follow me on Twitter, you may have already tuned into the new series I’ve been doing – #MorningWalkTalk. It’s pretty much just me chatting during my morning walks and filling you guys in on whatever’s currently on my mind. 

That being said, enjoy these quick takeaways from every walk talk I’ve done so far!

## **4/1 – Love YOUR brain. You may not be good at this, but you may be good at that.** 

## **4/2 Kindness starts at home. Be kind to yourself first.**

## **4/3 – Find the balance between humility and confidence.**
