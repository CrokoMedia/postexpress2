[0:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Mo8YPnEQA&list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs&index=2#) – What is the future of blogging in all this “rented” social media space?  
[2:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Mo8YPnEQA&list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs&index=2#) – What’re your thoughts on creating a successful, long term Social Media Strategy for yourself or your clients? What are the metrics you measure to make sure it’s working? How long in advance do you create the content you rollout?  
[5:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Mo8YPnEQA&list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs&index=2#) – I’m speaking to parents at a public school event on parenting in a social media world. What would you teach them?  
[7:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Mo8YPnEQA&list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs&index=2#) – We are in a “nonexistent” market (watch rental/sharing) but the sharing economy is growing. What would you do to determine/come up with a market size?  
[9:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Mo8YPnEQA&list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs&index=2#) – My investor wants to change the name of my company’s brand Sasquatch Fuel. We do backpacking meals and want to be as disruptive as possible in this vertical. Anything but generic like the competition. Should I change the name?

SUBMIT A QUESTION: [https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-y…](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-youll-need-to-get-garyvee-945936926.html "https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-youll-need-to-get-garyvee-945936926.html")

In 2003, 2004, and 2005, it was very commonplace to use the internet to drive someone to your home. As in, “Come here to consume me.” “Visit me here.” Now what we are seeing more is “I’m over here. If you want to know what’s up, you better learn how to speak to me here.”

What’s happened is that the attention graph (my biggest priority right now) is shifting. People’s willingness to jump somewhere to consume is certainly not down. The truth is, social networks, specifically Twitter and Facebook and Pinterest are really gateway drug pieces of content to drive to the aforementioned “home”: a blog. An e-commerce site. Your download page for your app.

What’s changed is people understand that they need a great skill and a great storytelling tactic to share with their social networks. They understand that they need to be that first impression to catch people’s attention.
