# The Best Way to Raise Money from an Angel Investor or VC

There is one question I get asked all the time. Sometimes even hundreds of times a day. It’s the question I get asked most frequently, out of all questions (and I get asked a lot of questions).

What is it?

> “Gary, how do I raise money from an angel investor or venture capitalist for my business?”

Simple. Maybe you even guessed it before I said it.

I get asked this question so much that I felt compelled to write this out, once and for all, to get my thoughts all down, on the record.

However, here is the issue: this question is one that I think really speaks to where we are right now in time, in history, in business. Founders are more concerned with raising the next round of funds than actually building the business itself.

But, here it is. I’m going to tell you how to do it, how do get it done, the best way to raise money for your startup. The number one way to raise money for your business is to build a good enough business that they all come to you.

That’s right. Here’s a novel idea: why don’t you build a profitable business with real value and real customers that pay (in whatever form that means for you)? Why don’t you build momentum and earned media and hype and leverage? Because then, people will email you. They’ll come to you. They’ll want you.

Why? Because you’re winning.

Execute, and then drive the behavior backwards.

A lot of people might respond to this with “What if you have no money? No funds?” If that’s the case, live a life that is predicated on no money. Get eight roommates if you have to. Live at home if you have to. Find your partner coder. Build your app.

Be scrappy for seven months if it means achieving your dream for the rest of your life. Maybe even be scrappy for a year or two. Because in the grand scheme of things, what is that amount of time compared to the rest of your life? Not very much. If you can eat crow, do it. Work hard and make them come to you. In the end, you’ll know how to survive the tough times, and you’ll be a far better entrepreneur and business person because of it.

Make them come to you by being so incredibly awesome, they can’t ignore you.
