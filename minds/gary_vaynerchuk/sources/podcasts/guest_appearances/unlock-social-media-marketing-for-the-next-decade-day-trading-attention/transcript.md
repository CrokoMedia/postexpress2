# Unlock Social Media Marketing For the Next DECADE — Day Trading Attention

day trading attention means that you do not put anything on a pedestal I have no romance to social to Google to Facebook to Tik Tok to myself or anything I've done prior to my career I care about today right now and what is overpriced and underpriced Behavior to make the thing that I want to happen happen all that is happening is supply and demand when Google AdWords came out I bought the word wine on Google AdWords the day Google AdWords came out for 5 cents and owned it for 9 and 1/2 months before anybody bid me up that's how you win if you are targeting the 13 to 20 year olds I just want to clarify it for you right now the only thing they give a crap about right now from storytelling platforms the way I look at them is Instagram Snapchat and Vine drum jar a a very famous Viner snapchatter instagrammer uh and I started an agency called grape story a sister agency to vayer Media all those characters um uh last May where we represent the uh best talent in the emerging content platforms to do branded content and things of that nature I actually think right this second as I tape this show Facebook is the best direct selling marketing platform in the world we're literally going to do a live QVC I think retail selling stuff on live is very real to me I'm a big believer in it Instagram is clearly going in the right direction I'm fascinated by musically right now it's a social network that's emerging I think musically is absolutely at least already in y y territory where it's like really got my attention Snapchat's more fruitful than Facebook right now video for somebody that's up and coming even though Facebook video is a big big big platform it's harder to break through that noise it's supply and demand of attention supply and demand of attention I think influencer marketing is going to have an incredible golden year of a decade I think we're in the beginning of it and I'm very fond of it organic reach of just posting on LinkedIn as if it was Facebook 9 years ago is at a level that I haven't seen since Facebook Tik Tok is in a place similar to all the platforms before it where the attention is so underpriced on Tik Tok as you know there is no version of you getting 4 million followers on Instagram in a month starting tomorrow Tik Tok is so unique right now the right answer is at this second to massively triple down on Tik Tok I want to start a social network that only lets you post once every 24 hours that's the Restriction YouTube shorts is incredibly interesting Twitter has announced that they're going to make a much bigger play towards the creative so I you know I would say 6 months ago it was pot committed Tik Tok I would argue that they're all going through the Merit of the creative is the distribution now and so all of them and because the best of the best are so focused on Tik Tok there might be even more Arbitrage in YouTube shorts or Facebook reels and things of that nature Facebook reals which are similar to Tik toks and Instagram reels have exploded Facebook dominates 5050 to 70 attention it is the only asset that everyone in here must Chase to produce what they want the reason to be early is no different than the reason to be early in real estate we're sitting here in Hudson yards we were here four years ago as a tenant that was a better price per square foot than it is now because this is all built out that's how I think about the end consumers awareness organic reach on Facebook 6 years ago when I was screaming at the top of my lungs was remarkably low and that really helps small businesses as larger businesses come in and start spending ad money the cost of getting into the stream goes up it's like everything else Super Bowl used to cost a lot less when a lot less people watched it day trading attention isn't about predicting what's next it's about staying on the pulse of where people's eyes and ears are today and marketing for the now wherever that happens to be the biggest misstep that I see from everybody is they're obsessed with yesterday they're curious and willing for tomorrow but they're missing the Mark today in 2042 I'm going to stand right here and be like you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiots still do social media I mean it day trading attention means that you do not put anything on a pedestal I have no romance to social to Google to Facebook to Tik Tok to myself or anything I've done prior to my career I care about today right now and what is overpriced and underpriced Behavior to make the thing that I want to happen happen period [Music]
