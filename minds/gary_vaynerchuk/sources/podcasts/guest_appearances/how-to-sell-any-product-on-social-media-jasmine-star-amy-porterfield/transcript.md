somebody who I have regular conversations with with my friends like he is my friend but the fact that I get to do it with an industry peer somebody I'm so happy and proud welcome back our co-host Amy Porterfield as she introduces yes girl so we're back we have a day full of empowering conversations around business but today we're really focusing on marketing I am so happy and proud to introduce founder entrepreneur multi-time New York Times bestselling author who's coming back yet again for another punch to our marketing face Gary Vayner Gary thank you and welcome to the Jasmine star show I'm so happy to be here thanks for having me ah okay so I asked Amy to be the co-host and I said Amy can you curate a group of people who are so well known about going against the grain so Amy can you introduce us how you and Gary got connected yes so Gary you do not know this but I would say 12 13 years ago well when did crushit come out how many years ago was that 2009 so 15 okay I was going to say 15 but I thought it was too much uh Gary gez we're getting old 15 years ago because here's it just kills me because here's the thing 15 years ago you wrote crushit and you did this special promo that if people bought bulk of your book you would make them a video and we could put the video out in our audience well I had just left Tony Robbins 15 years ago I had no audience yet so you can bet I spent money I didn't have to buy all these books and then you made a video for me I got to give all the books out to people that bought my new program you made a video and I just cherish that so that's where we started you didn't know we started back way back then but of course I've been a fan I've read every single book and I've loved everything you've done but also the reason I wanted to have you on here is as Jasmine said she's a huge fan but you don't know that she calls you garbear and I think you are her business Crush I mean I think is your husband okay with fully professional business Crush like so this is it and I'm happy that Amy brought up the book by as part of something she had did because it was 2015 and I was at an event and somebody generously graciously handed me a book and said hey you really need to read this book by this Gary and so I get on the plane I start flipping through the pages and I will tell you that jab jab jab right hook forever changed the trajectory of my life my career here's why and this is why I'm so passionate about dat shading attention because I can't wait to give this book to other people where I was in that journey and as I was sitting on that plane I'm flipping through the pages and for the first time in my entire life everything that I had said was uh ghetto everything I said was like shortsighted everything I was like I don't have a lot of money but I'm just doing what I can here I saw somebody who had built literally an Empire doing the very things that I had done so not only did somebody validate it you made it beautiful and you made it real and you made it tactile so then when I started reading datting attention you had said the alternate title of the book was jab jab jab left hook dude Gary I thought that was good I thought was good but we're here for day dating attention and we just want to say thank you you are of our people and you are for our people so we want to dive deep into marketing get some really practical tips to get us going so when we're talking Ames we're talking about the theme of going against the grain let's start here before we actually get into marketing because we want to have like a mindset shift how do we open ourselves to have the courage to do against what is the typical and the norm yeah so Gary we have a theme for all the interviews we're doing today and it's going against the grain and I feel as though you are the perfect person to talk about this tell me a time that you went against the grain in order to grow what you have today and also what kind of risk did you have to take to do it first of all ladies thank you so much you don't even you can't comprehend how humbling and warm that all just felt so thank you uh I have a pretty fun answer to this I'm not sure I've ever not gone against the graen and I'm not kid you know like yeah and I think this is where the weird thing is I I have not gone with the grain cuz the grain is not by definition entrepreneurial it tends not to be consumer Centric it's definitely never of the moment it's always grounded in yesterday I was at a a big marketing conference in Miami last week and I said this was for the Fortune 500 companies so the BMWs the coca-colas right the biggest brands in the world the Nissans and I said the thing with Big Brand marketing that's crazy to me is you're romantic about yesterday they're all still trying to do television commercials you're infatuated with tomorrow hold on we got hold on is it it's holy cow you would think I was a newbie that was my phone ringing and I've never had the ringer on Gary I am so sorry please please do not edit that out pleas let me please I thought it was you Gary I was like dude turn your phone off oh my gosh the industry is infatuated with it romantic about yesterday they love to do television commercials and all this crazy stuff they're obsessed with tomorrow they're thinking about building stores in the metaverse and Ai and we suck at today this is what I was saying to the industry and that's I would say that everything I mean when I told when my father told his liquor store contemporaries other guys he grew up with in the liquor store game in New Jersey that I was building a website for him multiple guys that he grew up with asked him not to do it cuz I was going to put him out of business when I started Wine Library TB in 2006 my father and my best friend Brandon and my cousin Bobby thought I'd lost my mind and I'm not kidding like genuinely they thought it was weird they weren't sure what I was doing um I don't know like I'm you know at you know again Amy because we've known each other a long time and actually I think you can really put a pin in this I think a lot of people back then with crush it and all this other stuff I you know I was saying this stuff in 2008 right cuz the book came out in 09 people thought I was crazy when I said that people were going to be able to make $100,000 a year talking about things they liked I mean I I'll be honest with you ladies I don't I don't ever think I am conformed to the norms it's why I got D's and Fs my whole life right like I just I knew School wasn't practical it wasn't right for me and I'm so obsessed with the end consumer that I think I'm with the consumer at scale in a way that most people aren't thus it seems what I'm doing is crazy here's a big one this one's going to land with you too remember when I started filming myself 24 hours a day yes yes when I started doing daily B and doing drock and all that a lot of people had a lot of things to say by behind my back who does he think he is this is so ridiculous charlatan you know and now it's the norm it's you know to for so many like so you know it's the story of my life okay so question for you then a lot of people are listening and they do not have the kind of courage or confidence you have to go against the grain so it was just it's part of who you are I think you came out of the womb going against the grain but a lot of people listening in Gary our audience they're they're making $100,000 in their business and they want to make a million but they are so afraid to do something different so they continue to do what everyone else is doing what would you say to them how do you give them that advice to go against the grain Against the Grain is actually the Practical thing to do what I say to them is I know a lot of people that have gone from 100,000 to zero cuz they didn't want to stop doing Google AdWords or email marketing or pamphlets or courses or like what I would say to them is if you don't put yourself out of business someone else is going to do it for you amen right and and just because I want to make sure everyone understood what I was saying there when I say put yourself out of business it means you need to try to do different things that might not work you're not going to put yourself out of business but what I mean by that is you need to innovate new things for you because if you don't someone else is going to do it and then you're going to be out and you know and like I mean look at search we're literally living in the pre-dawn of of AI the the The Meta AI the the chat GPT these like do you know many people run their entire business by Google AdWords what if people sto going to Google to search right that's like all the people that lived on Yellow Pages when I was doing websites and I said you're going to lose you need to have a website and search engines are coming but now people make fun of all those people like when I would do talks and everybody like the Yellow Pages people they would all laugh but now they've become the Yellow Pages people they're one-dimensional Google search so when you talk about um if I may we we share um a mutual friend and peer and when you talk about doing the things that are practical that the thing that is going to uh keep us in business that's going to keep us moving forward is doing the things that is unexpected and yes it does take a little courage but oftentimes we look at that as like the nitty-gritty work and there was an observation that I read from sahil Bloom and I feel like if I could read it it perfectly capsizes what it is you got to love the dirt Gary has had an incredible longevity in his career as an entrepreneur and Creator we were chatting about what one allows and continues to thrive in their business over long periods of time and his reply is you got to love the dirt the dirt is where you start it's where you build initial success doing the things that don't scale talking to customers spending time in the details testing and learning fast it's where you find the early gold but too many people get a tase of that gold and leave the dirt behind head up to the sky box and never build down in the dirt again this is why they don't last the dirt is where the game is played and the dirt is where the gold is found when somebody here is listening and they see what you have done and they see what you have built what does the dirt look like for Gary now like here you are with this amazing book and we're going to actually get into the amazing practical marketing applications but before we actually get to somebody doing implementation what we have discovered so deeply and distinctly is that so many people can't get past that initial fear or the stigma of what it means being in the dirt and so here you are embodying it what does the dirt look like for you now because we know there's YouTube Days of Wine Library what is it look like now you know I think the reason for example there still is a Gary ve brand is cuz I want to be in the dirt I mean what does the dirt look like again I assume this is audio but there's also is there going to be a video component to it good let me show you something this is just real life you don't even have to go very far right like the dirt looks like this the I'm just got to pull it up when I post social media content right when I post it I'm literally I'm writing the copy to my team of the post right like I'm literally writing that's right like I am like literally writing the copy right like it is I don't know what else to tell you like I'm reading I mean literally here's the post that all of you like I obviously this will come out but here's the post and there's the copy to the post I'm the copywriter for my social media posts I'm giving feedback on it I'm also reading the comments I'm dming people I'm you know uh in the book I talk about this role called the PCS the post creative strategist this is the person that reads all the comments after you post something for a brand I do that I'm a PCS I strategize the first second of the creative I talk to the team I I like to your point it's happening right now in the meta I'm in a point of my career thank God where this book will sell very well if I did no podcasts and no content it will but I want to do it for two reasons very frankly I'm so flattered that I know this is like a nice thing for you to like I don't know how to not continue to do that I want to give back to the game That Built Me and number two there are many people that are going to listen to this that are really hearing me in detail for the first time or might not even have a great perception of me but love you two and are like wait a minute I never got past the loud or the curse and like there is more de like so I I never have I never have a part of me that isn't interested in leaning into humility at all costs and another way to say the dirt is having the humility to keep doing the core principles that allow you to have the pulse of the consumer okay so let me be a devil's advocate so many business teachers and mentors will say you have to leverage so much in your business you can't be doing it all you can't be in the comments you can't be writing the copy you hire someone so you're never going to scale if you try to do it all but I feel like you're so different than that so what would you say to that that both work I have 43 full-time employees on my personal brand really really 43 that's right employ maybe it's like 29 now we're we're sending a lot of them into Vayner media a lot of them I train on my team and then but I believe in both I didn't make all these videos my team post produc it Dustin's filming me right now there he is there he is you know like like you know so so I think both are true I think I think that you know first you have to be able to afford a team I did all my own stuff for the first seven years yes then once you can afford a team this goes back to what sahal captured from our drinks like cool but you're also allowed to be in the dirt with with your team just just cuz you like think of it as like farming so at first you have a little farm and you're the farmer and then like things get going and your corn is selling and then you have enough money to hire someone and they're in the field with you but you should be in the field with them I agree and don't you think tell me if you agree or not with this where when you're first starting out I was just like you Jasmine is too we did everything in the beginning but I sometimes work with people that the minute they start a business they want to Outsource a bunch of the stuff especially the marketing well because well first of all yes and and there's a couple reasons first of all most people start a business to buy a Lamborghini or a beach house right so they're already Dead on Arrival because they're not doing it for the game they're doing it for the money and so the reason they get out of the dirt is cuz they don't like the dirt they don't respect the dirt they don't appreciate the dirt they're trying to get to the penthouse and in fact they're a lot of people try to not be in the dirt ever they think somehow miraculously like it's it's very funny out there and that happens in everything there's parents that are like that they never really wanted to parent there's there's coaches that think they're going to hire two assistant coaches and they're going to do everything and they're going to walk around and say they're the coach of the baseball team like all things come in all shapes and sizes there's people that think that they'll be in great shape without eating right and going to the gym like okay like knock yourself out it's not going to work out like so so yeah I mean I think and marketing to your point they want to Outsource because a lot of people don't know how to do it marketing is hard it's hard it's hard it's a dirty secret that people don't want to admit like this shit's hard this is what I mean did did the two of you or just one of you get to skim the book or read the book where you at with it I've read the book and I got it a little bit later but I've started it so here's the thing one of the one of the things that was cited in the book was like a kind of like three movements in uh social media so we started off algorithmically so you wouldd be posting post and you saw it whenever you logged in and so you'd be able to catch up with whatever that looked like and then the algorithm really changed where you had the Ed Edge rank was or sh being shown content by people who you know it's who you follow and then you express in the book The tiktock ification of what it means in the algorithm it's not just showing you people who you follow because your time and over time your interest change it's actually showing things that you have engaged with so can you explain that in a little bit granular detail now we're going to get in the dirt and I think we'd like to close the close the show with with up in the clouds what's next for us and like how implementing these strategies really being in the dirt the dirt in our hair and underneath our fingernails is empowering us to do the next level thing both inside and outside of anner media so ladies I think the thing that's really crazy is you know crush it in a lot of ways this is the followup to jab J JB Ray hook but there's a lot of crushit elements which is like if you do this well if you want to be known for being a peanut butter expert or being you know a businesswoman boss or being a a landscap aper or known for you know Beauty like you implement this you will get awareness you will have opportunity but what's interesting about it is it's easier now than when I wrote crush it or jab jab jab right hook because to your point and you broke it down beautifully Jazz like it used to be email marketing you would try to get as many people to follow you as possible and then a percentage of them would see your content now individual pieces of content find audience it's the interest graph right back to visuals this is Facebook Twitter and and tumbler stock there were companies that I first invested in when I invested in Tumblr I thought that Tumblr was going to be bigger than Facebook and Twitter because I was obsessed with this idea of following interests not people because I felt interests had more Evergreen than people because I knew that a lot of people were going to be young and things change a lot with your social graph between High School to college College to Post colle and even your 20s into your 30s and so pre kids so it made sense to me that like my love affair with the New York Jets or my or hip-hop or video games or trading cards would stay with me much longer than maybe the kids I grew up with but then when I moved away or my college friends and we moved like and so we are now in the incraft world and so for everyone who's listening this is very exciting You' got three people in here whove put a lot of work in to building audience and being known the fact that you at home if you're good enough with your content this is why I wrote the book with such detail of how to be good at the content your speed in getting awareness is much faster I had to build a slow building over time to become a big building people can get it faster now because the algorith like if you're that person you can go from zero to a million followers way faster now because your content will be seen and so we now live in the interest graph algorithmic Tik Tock ification world meaning Tik Tok started that Trend musically Tik Tok and now every single platform from LinkedIn to YouTube shorts to Facebook to Twitter to Instagram to threads like you're you're it's the content's reaching an audience that might like it not who followed you yes a percentage of who followed you but it's a whole different game you know you start off the book with such a palpable story with dog face and the reason why it hit home for me and I want to be very clear if you are looking if you're a business owner and you're looking for a manual an sop of digital marketing right now this is it at the end of the book there are a Litany of examples you do not have an excuse after reading the book to know what to do or what to try and I want to just like hone in on one key point if there's one sentence out of this whole book that you could walk away with is there's never been a greater time for you to get attention on social media because you're no longer on the outskirts of getting people interested in you all you need to do now which is insane Ladies as you know I'm sorry to interrupt but which is insane because you would think it's counterintuitive everyone listening right now would think oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] these three have really earned over the last decade or half decade this spot how could I have done nothing I don't even have an account oh my God wait a minute are these three say like blow us out of the water exactly yes that's insane that's insane when I think about what I believe in I'm like oh my God this is like the greatest gift ever and people are going to blow it because they're going to come up with excuses your point is taken I wrote this book to suffocate every excuse and yet people won't do it and I know that because look the foundations of being in shape are out there with eating and exercising we all know it's not like you don't know it's not like I'm walking around being like no I think if I eat a ton of carbs and don't exercise it's all going to be epic like we know it but can you do it so true so what are the common things that you see stopping like you've you speak on stages you go in from the boardrooms to warehouses to schools what is stopping this is how you two are going to like this this is how I involved into the Gary vinner I am now I used to think it was tactics and all my books were written like that and then I realized it was insecurity absolutely because even in your story in the beginning of the book dogface almost didn't even post that video video that got the millions and millions of views and Gary I've got to tell you I'm very guilty of not posting videos CU I think I look like an idiot and I know reading your book I know that's one of the biggest mistakes because you say someone else is going to find it valuable just get it out there many of us stop yeah and look it's hard like many of us stop because we're insecure about the way we look yes yes right like sound whatever it is yeah people don't like the S like I hate it I hear people saying I don't like the sound of my voice I'm like why it makes me want to cry for them it makes me want to cry emotional so what do you say to them I say that I I say that I'm desperately scared of regret everyone's going to be 90 God willing and you're going to be like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] why didn't die yes just yesterday I had a gentleman tell me on a live video Amy I want to post these videos I'm making them like you say I need to make them but I look at myself and I'm 60 years old and I look so old and I look around and everyone's Young on Tik Tok and I just can't do it and you're saying but it's that regret if you don't correct because because he's going to be 80 not 60 and he's going to think he looked phenomenal at 60 number one amen and number two I live my life out of the great fear of regret and I think everyone ends up there whatever you're scared of now it's not going to be as scary as being 91 and realizing you never followed your true self okay so I didn't think we were going to go here but here we are so when we talk about making scary decisions I've talked openly on my podcast about how uh back in 2017 there was an opportunity for an event through Vayner media called Fords and it was $10,000 at the time I don't even know it's probably a lot more now but at the time it was $10,000 to spend a day at Vayner media with the Vayner team and then you would come in and you would do a 1-h hour Q&A at the end of the day and I got this invitation via email and I don't even think there was a website I don't even think there was like a sales page and I thought it was the craziest idea I asked my best friend I asked my dad I asked my husband business partner I'm like I think this is a crazy idea and I made the commitment and I went it was phenomenal I had the best time I sat around a conference table with 19 other incredible entrepreneurs and I walked away from that event asking a question knowing that I would get an answer that would changed my career and it did that year based on a lot of conversations we had in the room had built out a team and then yet another seven figureure Revenue stream in the business so I looked back at that event I was like wow that was gamechanging well a little bit ago we talk about making another big decision ision I got an invite uh to be a part of a program called Viv Vive see it's so new I don't actually know how to pronounce it Vive and it was a considerable investment to join a four-month program through the team with Vayner and having access and proximity to you so I went through the application process they told me how much it was going to be and I was like oh my God this is crazy is this crazy and then my husband looked across from me and he said Looking Back Now at who you were at 2017 having invested $10,000 you would even blink an eye to do that today he's like what if we were to build the next level of this business to look back at this investment and think it wasn't even a thing so when we think about making these big decisions and big Investments leveraging your personal brand talking about what you're doing on the back of social media I have consistently followed suit I will continue to post I will continue to show up I will continue to still feel awkward but not want to live with regret and so then we get to this point where somebody says okay now it's time for me to bet on me is there a time in your life or career where you said I'm going to bet on me and then what came out from that opportunity I mean I've I've only bet on me right like the biggest bet I probably made was the first one which was I believe that I'm so remarkable thank you Mom that that I think I can actually spend the first 10 to 15 years of my career building a business for my parents and then leaving with nothing and starting over you know my story has been massaged for I mean many people know my actual story but there are many people cuz I read the comments who like to think like my I mean I read a comment the other day on a Tik Tok post they're like how do we listen to this guy he inherited a winery I laughed so hard when I read that I was like first of all it was a liquor store in New Jersey and second of all you can go look at who owns it now I sure don't like I I think the biggest bet I ever made on me was actually that I wouldn't resent my parents and that's probably the biggest bet I made I knew that I loved them so much and I admired them so much and that I thought I was so capable it's pretty insane in hindsight at the time it seemed really logical to me but it's pretty insane to like decide when you're me that you're going to go work in your dad's liquor store for what ended up being every day for 12 years and I'm still close to it every day six or seven days a week 10 or 15 hours a day give up your entire higher 20s of enjoyment and joy and never get paid $100,000 a year while you build them a massive business and then leave and start Vayner media and I had so little money I had to start it in buddy media's conference room because I didn't have money to pay for rent that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy yes so I bet on myself emotionally think about what I did I bet on myself emotionally I thought I would be emotionally strong enough to not not be upset that I did that and I ended up being very right absolutely Gary I was thinking when you were saying that I'm sure you've been asked this question a bunch of times but I've got to ask it let's pretend that today you are starting from scratch let's pretend that you do not know all you know about social media like you you know every which way compared to most people but you're the average person just starting out you want a dog walking business but you want to teach people how to train their dogs online as well okay can I actually can we actually Workshop this because um Gary you have a ton of examples in the book so we're going to look at this as like an amou like prior to prior to the the flame and Yan arriving to the table when you get that book what we want to do is give somebody who right now is sitting with just their phone yes they don't have a ring light they have a virtual assistant who helps them 5 to seven hours a week they are at $100,000 they want to explode their dog walking business they feel very stretched for time this is likely a side hustle that is taken over some of their full-time work but they still have another job what are you telling this person to do so three action items that they can do this week to get from here to there number one strategy so let's talk about this the way you set it up I'll give you the actual answer hey Sally or Johnny you've gotten to $100,000 as a side hustle we're we're halfway home by the way I'll make this even more exciting if somebody's made $11,000 I'll take it down let's go there I'm going to go there so you're telling me you made $111,000 either in ads from YouTube or you sold a t-shirt or you've done two brand deals and wait a minute you're telling me you're doing that with one or two hours a night because you got a family and you need some rest and you actually work 9 to5 to begin with and there's a commute and you've been able to make $11,000 with just an hour or so like you that means you already have the propensity and the knowledge that this could easily be $200,000 if you just amortize out the hours right or 400,000 so first it's just the strategy of realizing it can happen because most people don't think it can happen for them what do you mean advertise the hours well if you make $111,000 and you only spent an hour a day on it and that means you're putting five hours a week cuz on the weekends your kids have three different sports and this that the other thing well if you're spending 5 hours on it a week to make 11,000 what happens if you spend 60 hours on it okay right so if you amortize out the average amount of money you make per hour what happens is once you give up the job and you go full-time on it and of course we have to talk about savings and be able to afford to make the leap there's things to talk through here but the first place I go to to the person you just talked about is making them realize that there's a high percentage chance that if they've already made 11,000 not zero for everyone who's listening who's saying I'm gonna I don't want to hear your I'm gonna I'm only talking to the people that have done and have made over $110,000 as a 1 hour side hustle a day now if you tell me no no Gary I actually put 29 hours into 10,000 then I'm like okay let's take a step back you're not as good as that other person right because it's just math but what I what I want them to know is they can they need to know they can that in that what are three things this person right now what are the three things that you're saying listen buy the book after the book here are the three things I need you to do or try look real real talk if they and you know this ladies if they buy the book all the answers to my question are in the book and I don't mean that as a book plug like go to pyate Bay and steal it I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] buy the book it is very actionable it is very actionable it is it is an it is a homework here here's what you two know cuz you guys are deeper like this is even deeper like jazz this is really fun like you may know you probably agree with me on this this shit's deeper than D oh yeah like this $28 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dollars right so what what do I think the answer is very simple I believe whoever makes the most amount of meaningful content in the world wins whether that's YouTube me Alex Earl charlee demilio Logan Paul like like I don't know like it's not complicated whoever is best at social media creative organically not paying ads in that scenario the dog walking person needs to make as much content as she or he can about dog dog walking now there's ways to do that someone's like well how where everyone gets stuck is what do I make all the time question well just green screen alone I can literally right now Google I'm going to do it actually I can Google dog walking I'm going to do this on a spot like we're being really we're doing a moose Bo we might as well do it dog walking all right when I type in dog walking now I'm going to go to a very important place on Google News okay okay see what he's doing I know what he's doing first Kim Kardashian used to be Madonna's dog walker right literally here it is okay recently saw that I did see that online yes well if you're a dog walker I'm screens shooting this like I just did and I'm making a green screen that says hey everybody see what dog walking can do for you you can eventually and the fact that you responded that way that all of a sudden becomes a video that might get 880,000 views on Tik Tok from someone who's never made a video or has historically sucked at it they did a green screen there was no production value I can do my own green screens when I started doing them on my team chat I'm like all of you are in trouble I might not need any of you I might just green screen my way but here's why it's important when that gets 80,000 views because my profile on Instagram YouTube shorts Tik Tok is perfectly done my bio's right my link is there my phone number is there my emails there you're going to get seven customers from it and on and on and on and on there's nothing more important than organic social media okay I agree but using your book because I write notes in my books and my friends when I share my books uh they write notes back to me but I had written more more relevant to a variety of demographics is what results in sales so content isn't enough content that scales a brand revenue is the goal but you had said that relevancy is the stuff that is going to get you the results that you want that was a key thing that I took away as the biggest takeaway it's not just content it's relevant content so using that Kim Kardashian and Madonna it would be well you can talk about dog walking and get attention from somebody who would never be paying attention to you because if you could hash Kardashian or Mna so I just wanted to make sure that we're connecting the dog let me give you let me give you another one I'm just going to keep flowing now you now as a dog walker you make a video that's titled why dog walking is the perfect first job for your four 14-year-old and then the video is hey parents do you have a child that you're ready to get a job for but they're kind of pushing back cuz they're cliche gen Z let's talk about dog walking now why that's important when you put that into the algorithms that's going to reach parents let's take this to the next level now this is the dog walker who is in De Moine and wants to drive business using the green screen so while it's great that they can get attention and go viral on Tik Tok that's actually not their main goal their main goal is to get walkers how do we connect a do between de Mo doging green screen like let's go easy gets 8,000 now you're like wait a minute this video is better than the other ones then you take that video you slightly tweak it you take the original video and at the end you add another part of the video and if you need a dog walker hey De Moine if you need a dog walker I'm available link and bio here's my email you then run an ad there in a in a 10 mile radius or all of De Moine you spend 90 $90 on Facebook Instagram 90 you see how it does you get four emails because of that you're like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is remarkable you can then spend 200 more 400 more so that's why you have to go organic because you can then turn it into performance and sales after you see if there's interest in the general video and you make it localized whether you're a barber or a hairdresser or a landscaper or a flower shop or a liquor store or a bowling alley you got it you go General you let the algorithm confirm there's something there there once you do that you make it slightly you tweak it slightly to be localized and a little more sell cuz you're selling and then you run low low amounts of media specifically on meta cuz Facebook and Instagram perform better right now than Tik Tok and YouTube shorts and then you could scale it from there we go into that but that's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] game okay this is why I'm loving your book because one of the things my students ask a lot is how do I know what to make an ad about and when I was reading your book you literally lay out this is how you decide if it should be an ad this is when you should turn it into paying some money with it I want to just make one more plug about the book it's very actionable like that and why Jasmine and I were so excited to have you on and talk about this is our audience are literally asking every single question that you are answering in this book so I guess one of the questions well did we do the three though Jasmine I don't want to get a sop track no we did we did we took actable things and we went through green screen we went through creating enough content organically to then see what actually works and then what we would do is we' get that we would recreate it and run an ad set to it so three action items that they can start doing this week and when you were saying all that Gary one of the things that I was thinking and I want to know what you think about this is a lot of times people don't post because they're looking for a post that will go viral they're saying well I need one that's going to get me even like hundreds and hundreds of views so they're thinking about how many views can I get with this so they're not posting I'm guessing that's a big mistake yes look this is a crazy thing to say but it's straight [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] real I get more excited when my posts flop than do well why why would you say that minimum equally Dustin always Snickers a little bit but like I'm telling you I don't communicate it to him or even the team how much I deeply secretly love it it's because I'm learning from it like I I want the humility I I do believe subjectively I'm at the tippy top of the game and it feels incredibly validating to me knowing how hard this is and why we all have to continue to work on it it's why I called it day trading attention you've got to do this daily it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard game it's like if you're a day trader of stocks you've got to be hands on keyboard all day long to find those micro Arbitrage moments same with this why do I like it because my self-esteem is not wrapped up in how many views I get on a video that's why my self-esteem is not wrapped up in how many views I have in a video amen so um on that note as we close this we started off the conversation with the mindset shifts that we're going to have to take as entrepreneurs to show up as our full selves and do things that other people are not willing to do and have the humility to be in the dirt and then build and then we talked about uh taking risks and betting on yourself and that comes very naturally to you and we also talked about going against a grain which comes very naturally to you and part of that is anchored with where we just ended the conversation which is uh having the ability to see oneself and not judge oneself in addition to that cherry on top of the cake we had three action items that people can start doing this week to have a profound impact on their business and we talk about being at the tippity top and we talk about the things that you're doing um I have to say if you don't mind if you don't mind uh back in 2018 I have been following your stuff I've been investing your stuff and I had bought a series of K Swiss and part of buying this this uh bulk of shoes from kwis was that I had an opportunity to ask you a question on Instagram live so this is from a slack message to my team in 2008 as some of you saw I was slated to go live with Gary yesterday on Instagram and it felt like Christmas Eve I was more than ready I even hired a videographer to show up and record it for 10 minutes I tried unsuccessfully to join his live and he didn't see me at all when he ended the call I was shocked we had been planning that call for almost 2 months I was so sad okay fine I cried which is so stupid I know it was ridiculous I know it was ridiculous I couldn't get my trash together I felt like something slipped out of my hands but this is what I know something better is coming I believe it yesterday wasn't meant to be and I trust that something better is on the horizon to serve a bigger purpose and here we are dude from a failed IG live to right now it's like we started from the bottom and now we're here Gary thank you thank you my friend you are incredible this book is incredible Amy and I cannot say enough good things I have to know I have you to know Gary Amy gets pitched a boatload I get pitched a ton to talk about books and the vast majority is no but this book Amy has already bought it for her team I am highlighting it and saying it to my team and I was like y we got we got we got the early issue what a what stood what what made you know it's funny the reason I'm jumping in is I'm so convinced that this is the book out of every book I've written because I think the Tipping Point of everyone realizing social media marketing is now the absolute number one most important thing it's actually the book that I think is going to most likely have the single buy like literally like I'll just use a cliche example a flower store owner is going to buy it cuz they're a fan of you to they're listening now and when they read it they're like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and they're going to buy six copies for everyone that works at the flower shop even the guy in the back that just cuts like because they're going to realize okay this is some like so it's interesting the reason asking cuz I'm curious aim like what back to that point cuz you actually just did the thing that I know and I know that there's been other books I've written that you've bought aim that you did not buy for everyone on the team which gets me to the point what do you think made you want to buy it for everybody on the team two things and I literally texted Jasmine last night like oh my gosh this book and so it's two things number one I am all about action I want people just to get into action and do the thing and so there's no excuse when you have this book you tell them exactly what to do and how to do it there is no question I feel like it's the guide book for exactly what's happening in modern marketing today so that was number one and number two you said it in the book you cannot ignore this you cannot run a successful business without this so let's go the time is now no more excuses I loved every minute of it it's interesting like this is not a joke you guys might laugh I literally was weirdly bored at moments of reading the book for the audio version cuz it's so detailed it started making me feel like I was in school is it it is though it it honest to God is a textbook so it's like you can't nobody has excuses anymore because I think in jab jab jab right hook we talked about it in theory and you gave examples and you profiled you profiled businesses but not like this it's like literally screen grabs of content there's like screens there's like charts and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this one there's charts there's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] charts lots of examples you bring it to life lots of examp we're obsessed we are obsessed and we are so excited but did you like this part where there's like the QR codes I'm pumped about this part where like talk about it but you could actually like pull it up on your okay hold on so for those of you who are not watching the video and you're just listening to the audio as you go through the book this is so freaking smart is he's he's highlighting an example of a piece of content but it's just a screen grab because it's like paper and so R code you can scan the QR code and then it'll pop you up to that piece of content and I just have to say as a sidebar any Creator who Gary is freeing shout out like y just yall getting like one of the greatest marketing books to go down like in this decade and you're getting this shout out let's go Gary you should get a see exactly there's charts y'all like Gary got D's in school and yet created a textbook how's that for Full Circle moment I literally wanted you to hear this like it really was the weird weirdest thing I could like I'm I'm always Focus on like my life works on why I talk so much about passion and doing what you like when I like something I'm like so laser focused like I know like there's a piece of dust going by when I don't like something I glaze over it like like I have to have like real family members be my lawyers because I'm not reading a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] contract I mean I glaze over it after the first sentence starts this was so School in certain parts of the book because I was Dy to write the book that got the reaction that you two are giving me from people that look like you two meaning I can write a social media 101 book in an hour every day of my life until I die I wanted to write the 301 course the one you take junior year of college where you're like you know like as you the reason you said earlier we get pitched so many books the reason you got two don't get excited is you're like I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] knew this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 5 years years ago that is so true it felt so it felt elevated but still very doable that you hit it on the head right there cuz it is but I think what was really fun for me when I wrote it some of the people on my team so Vayner media is completely exploded Vayner X Sasha group all of it has exploded in the last three years and I mean exploded like you I'll share like we went from a $100 million Revenue business to 350 million that's a lot of growth in a very short period of time yes but it's because we figured this out four years ago like I really got I really hit another gear ironically at the expense a little bit of my own personal content I'm so busy building the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] machine and I'm so in the office all the time and now out and about I'm not giving my team the daily Vlog content to make like it's really funny though I think we're on the we're starting to like the reason I'm even saying it is cu I think we're about to really crushed too but what's crazy about this book is there's multiple people in my company that are upset about this book this is Real Talk cuz they feel like every advertising agency is going to read it and like I gave away our secrets and I told you and I told them I said it doesn't matter people aren't going to do it did you just say people are not going to do it yes that makes me sad but it's true me too but it's true like like it's what I I definitely did what I always do I simplify [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I did it in wine I do it in marketing I do it in life I'm good at that it's all there as you know I wrote it in a manner that would work for a lot of people that don't love my content because I'm very macro I went very micro this is like there are C there are people that are very different than me that are straight A students that this is going to be their favorite Gary ve book I already know it but I still know that people aren't going to do it because it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard but it's actually but it's easy it's the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everything in life going to the gym every day is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard if it doesn't come natural to you but a someone who didn't do it for the first 38 years of his life but has done it for the last 10 years of the life but then there's a Tipping Point and then it becomes easy it's still kind of hard because it doesn't come natural but you can understand how to do it I used to tell people 10 years ago that I didn't go to the gym cuz I was too busy I am 400,000 times more busy today than I was 10 years ago I go every I go I go every day because you know the rewards you know what it will do for you you believe in it and that's why I'm so obsessed with this one like I know just like crush it and Jab jab jab Jazz thank you so much for saying it I get it every day every day of my life I get an email or DM multiple by the way of someone telling me that crush it Endor jab jab jab right hook and occasionally crushing it changed their life every day I think this book is going to do 10 times 20 times that by itself CU I know I pushed myself further than I've gone with the others and and that's and that's why I think you two reacted this way and and I wrote it for you meaning I wrote it for people that really know me or really know somebody else that really knows it like they themselves know it they're actually winning but they don't realize how much they're leaving on the table because if I wrote it that way it's definitely going to work for everybody who's listening who's never done it M I love that I love that Gary we want to say thank you for your time we want to say thank you for inspiring us and thank you for reminding us that it is simple it is not easy for you saying it is hard it's like fine so we accept the hard and we drink from that cup and so uh for those of you for those I apologize for interrupting but it's also fun it is if you let it let it this is why I want people to do it around dog walking or pizza making or building jungle gyms or Legos or reading bedtime stories do the thing around things you like don't chase Trends don't chase crypto or cannabis or real estate because you think that's where the money is do it around things you either a really know or B are just obsessed about if you're obsessed about the Phoenix Suns make your content about the Phoenix Suns and oh by the way let me give you another one powerful part of talk about in the book and it can be and I make content about the Jets and garage sailing and V friends and business and marketing and wine too many of you listening think you know I need a niche your Niche is you yes I love that and Gary I think I can speak on behalf of Amy and myself thank you for seeing us as a niche as individuals as entrepreneurs thank you for taking time out of your schedule to talk about a book we love and will be giving away to people we love for people who wanted to connect with you and give you a shout out your Gary ve on all social platforms anywhere else besides going to your local book retailer and buying day trading attention anywhere else you want to send people nah I think back to first thank you okay in the history of all podcast I've ever done no one has ever said n like they're like yes in this place you're like nope book hit me social yes so honestly it's weird I really didn't want to do any marketing for this book because I think this is the first one since crush it that it's going to do the work by itself I really believe that I really believe well we're very glad that you decided to do this because this was a delight to us so thank you so much oh [Music]
