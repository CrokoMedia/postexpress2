# 3 New Social Media Trends to Watch — School of Greatness Lewis Howes

you've always told me and a lot of your followers ahead of time this is what's coming yes uh you know you are early Twitter be on Twitter this is what's happening this is what's happening now early Instagram Facebook LinkedIn you were like always pushing Tik Tok you were like the first one on Tik Tok Snapchat I remember you looking me in the eye saying be on Snapchat that was the only thing that like didn't work for me but everything else has worked for me who knows what's going to happen with Tik Tok Instagram Facebook all these different platforms uh when we're thinking of attention and the future Ai and the freaking mobile devices and the things that have a chance as you know what I'm great at is not predicting but moving so goddamn fast when it happens and going all in yeah that I have that Advantage what is here got here's here's things that have are coming one for people like you and I all of our content in every language at scale we've got a million subscribers on Spanish on YouTube in our voice oh yeah that's the key that's what we're working on uhhuh so I and and we you've seen it already Dustin like we're pretty close we're almost done I'll be speaking every language in my voice in my little high pitches in me that's gonna be huge for every through AI right that's right is there a tool specifically you're looking at that you're we're using re speecher there's a b there's I mean it's moving so notice how I hesitate even though I'm a big fan ofer G that game is AI eating itself up is just like crazy yeah um so AI virtual influencers oh yeah that's coming I've seen the people are blowing up already with you mean just like made up influencers that's right yeah AKA very attractive people on Instagram that you're like and that will go that will go not just right now the early movers like always are like models and like all that but it will be full pledge Ricky Thompson 47y old marketing expert who's going to have 14 million followers and it's joh at it's Joanna Thompson in in Australia that actually owns him and is run oh it's gonna be huge so virtual influencers are you getting into some of that too yeah I'm I'm really starting to go deep on that live streaming as as a more scaled everyday thing let me explain what I mean by that me saying live streaming is important it's not kaet and like Aiden Ross and like ninja clicks like plenty of people are crushing on Twitch and other things no I mean what I'm up to now which is I have camera in my office on mute for 13 hours a day and I'm just sitting there it's entrepreneurial ASMR it's mute mute because I'm having real meetings so people are watching you watching me hearing you that's right and I try to unmute and D did a good thing for me created an unmute uh counter and I'm like looking at him like oh I haven't unmuted yet hey everyone like literally wow 13 hours a day that's right people making pizza people I predict in five years someone who loves to loow theirm La law M Lawn thisx M Lawn will go from like that's that classic dad who does it two the modern dad the 28-year-old who's destined to be a 48-year old dad who loves to mow their lawn like loves it is destined right now as we're speaking to one time in seven years as he's on that Journey streaming it for some weird reason it today every 42-year-old 61y old man or woman that loves to lawn for an hour and a half a big lawn does not think let me set up a laptop and stream live on TW doesn't cross their mind I believe it will become known I believe one of them will do it I believe for whatever reason it will crush and I believe that person will a year later retire from being a principal in a high school to making a million dollars a year mowing lawn mowing their lawn live streaming it live streaming it so think about how different that is than what I predicted with crushit remember what I predicted with crushit which was insane which is influencers going to make money I didn't call it influencers we didn't have the term yet right people will make money on the internet being themselves that was like right now somebody's like wait a minute I will literally make a full-time living by streaming making breakfast for my family every morning dude let me just say that you know how insane that is crazy man like literally a mom or dad let's say a stay-at-home dad or momra is literally going to start streaming her 6:00 a.m. to 7:30 of prepping breakfast for everybody and it's going to capture a fever and they're going to get millions of viewers every morning and they're going to get subscribers for two bucks Mon and they're going to get merch Deals Deals yeah I'm seeing there's a guy on Tik Tok who goes live it must be all day he's live He's he owns a little Fruit Stand he's just cutting up fruit and he's got a massive line every day that just wants to like be in the Stream for a second that's right live streaming cutting fruit it's crazy the extreme version of what I saw happening with crushit is about to happen with live streaming because it takes it to passive instead of progressive I had to sit down and do the wine show now it becomes passive I will stream while I'm running my wine store but will people watch yes hours of content when when you need to be 5 Seconds of videos that people are like losing attention no because PE people are watching long form content at scale right now you know this you just don't want to be in the middle you want to either be great at short form or you want to be great at long form you just don't want to be the middle or you don't want to be bad at long form or bad at short form you could make people will watch a people binge watch an entire season of something on Netflix or sit I have people that sit with me you know this sit with me the whole day that's crazy they sit there the whole day and talk to each other that's crazy well that's Community I mean it's amazing it's crazy it's it's funny it reminded me you might remember this when I was coming up the game on Twitter and and viddler YouTube what was it Periscope well that was later uhhuh and mirat mirat but what about before Booth Ustream Ustream manam and that was big for me wow I remember that I would have been a huge streamer but now I'm too busy so my like couple hundred people I have nothing because I'm not there's nothing right now to Dustin and team's credit now they're playing my recent videos in the top right corner during the live stream so right so I'm a mute but on the top right corner in a smaller box is going to be this literally this and like so like you know like we're figuring it out and like and again I think there's going to be way more compelling ASMR I can tell you right now it would have been much more compelling to follow me tasting wine all day or like what I'm doing right now is really boring I'm sitting in an office for like 12 hours day just doing meetings uh I'm not even in the old drock daily V world where I was moving around a lot I'm cuz I'm in full operations mode on bner X and friends right now I'm in one of those Mo modes you know I'm not in Gary beand as much yeah he [Music]
