# The Ultimate Marketing Strategy Revealed — The Skinny Confidential

the single most important thing in all of marketing is first and foremost organic social media then everything else social media organic more important than commercial more important than your email newsletter more important than a billboard more important than hiring Beyonce to be in your Super Bowl spot more important to anything else if you are not the best in the world at organic social media I'm talking cross platform I'm talking snap Spotlight I'm talking Instagram I'm talking YouTube proper YouTube short I'm talking podcast I'm talking newset I'm talking for real for real attention is the number one asset this is full circle for me because my dad gifted me crushit I want to say 14 years ago right before I launched the skinny confidential I read it I highlighted it I Doge eared it then after implementing it you came to me I want to say eight years down the line and I got to be in your book crushing it and then I was on your show and now we're interviewing you it's a weird moment it's a it's a family affair I was saying how you're like the internet's dad like your students or your kids are growing up in like a real way yeah you know it's like Prof I mean I was at door Dash yesterday this kid's 32 he came up to me at a Super Bowl party I stopped by yesterday when I was in San Francisco and he's like you and I had a call when I was 14 I cold emailed you in Hong Kong and said can I speak to you about entrepreneur ship you said yes I'm really good at remembering [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like really good especially not names but visuals and moments I I couldn't recall it I don't like bullshitting I couldn't recall it this dude's like actually the full story was at a Super Bowl party this year at Michael rubin's fanatic super party the bougie one like this kid comes up this woman comes up to me excuse me his wife and goes you need to meet someone I'm like of course she's like tell them the story he's like I was 14 Hong Kong you made me believe in entrepreneurship all the way through and then she goes this is the co-founder of door Das and like and we were hanging out yesterday we were chopping it up and like you know not only I'm in a very wild part of my career like watching all of you like really when you've been putting out as much content about what you thought would happen and then it happened and it's impacting so many people and it's positive and you get to be in the airports or literally on the way here like we're working on the Be Friends theme song and music for the cartoons that are coming out and the music group the team that brought them in they're like they're the hottest they're the best they're winning they've done all these shows and then they start the meeting with Gary our company took off because we read your book and the people that introduced us didn't even know that it's like I'm in this incredible period because I'm still young right I'm still like in my journey yet to your point I've been on this kick for 15 years and a lot of people that were like 19 are now 34 you know 28 or now 43 like and then like watching y'all and so many others who I know a book or a video changed the course of their careers God it's it's um it's humbling beyond belief I think what stands out for me is that that book was so different than anything that was on the market it was so AV on guard and it was so it was like it was like the discipline and the hard work and putting in the Reps and the consistency and it's like it is all the things that happened and the thesis people will become famous and build businesses around the things they're interested in at scale and people [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on me heavy when that book came out it came out in 09 I wrote it in 08 this is like 15 years ago now that we right when we were getting out of school how did you have a nose for that looking back cuz now you have the perspective it's it was you know how some like I don't know like why does he have such great hair and so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] handsome like you're born with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm born with some sort of ability I don't know like I'm born with some sort of ability to have a very good sense of what people are going to do before they understand they're even going to do it I've always been good at that it's how I built my dad's wine store I knew that Australian and New Zealand wines were going to get hot Spanish wines and like nobody in the wine industry saw it like I I'm very good at that I mean you you think about your careers you know that I was the loudest un musically and like like this is what I do like I'm that guy there is I was just think I told you before we started like there were so many places that we could take this interview we've been so aware of your content and so been so critical in our careers and the development and I was thinking the last time we sat down it was actually the very first thing I ever did publicly ever with your show he's not gone snuck on I forgot I know if I was M up I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up for snuck on the show I got invited and Michael was like no no no I'm coming on with you there's if I'm listen I'm going to take the shot you know if I can take the shot god I remember now I was like what and he we had matching leather jackets I'm like it was a little strange looking yeah like it I found it it was episode 191 and it was Marg in 2016 the reason that date so important is that was the same exact week we launched this show the very first episode ever and you played such a critical part cuz we would drive back and forth to San Diego from LA San Diego La all the time and we would listen to The asgary V show you and some other guys and it was like I remember trying to think you I've always been kind of an operator behind the scenes guy but I remember listening to you on that show like Oh I like that format like I could do that you know what's interesting I'm an operator you know like the thing that's always been weird about me is that I always love when people come to vayer like influencers or other people we we do a lot of that we always trying to give love just like I did with all with you I continue to do that even at this place of my career like random 15minute meeting with some kid that's like I love it I love the come up right and the amount of people that come into Vayner media and are like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is this and I'm like what do you mean they're like what is this I'm like this is my company Vayner media they're like huh like the amount of people that think like I'm an influencer or a personality or motivational speaker or an author like the reason operators always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with me is cuz I'm an operator the second part of what I was going to tell you which is it was a real moment in my life personally was I I read the book with Lauren and I started talking a lot it was a lot of talk and I'm like wait a minute I came and saw you in your office and you're you talk but what people don't realize about you is what you actually do most of the time is operate massive businesses all over the place and that's your main like the the thing people see is the side thing and I saw that with you and I was like okay that shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up more go do the thing yes you can talk along the way about the thing but go do the thing actually and it was a moment like as a young guy I was looking around there's all all sorts of people on the internet and it's like who do you listen to and I remember like you were the North St I was like oh this guy you can listen to because he actually is doing the thing when a lot of people are talking about the thing but not actually it's why Vayner media has become one of the largest independent agencies in the world literally 15 years ago I started vayer media I was in the wine retail business running my dad's wine store and in 15 short years we've built a 2,000 person Global Agency for Gamble and Pepsi and Fanatics like we're we're it like I was just in Miami at possible conon like everyone knows in advertising the Mad Men like the people that do the advertising for BMW and for The Gap and for Exxon and like the biggest that world everyone knows they're on call that I'm coming to get them and the reason we're winning is that now that social media organic creative is the starting point of marketing organic social media create the wrot the reason I wrote day trading attention which is the followup to Je jab hook the reason I wrote it is cu as we sit here today the single most important thing in all of marketing is first and foremost organic social media then everything else go on that well the reason he even have a podcast is more about the clips for organic social than the podcast itself like I literally did daily V and I did ask Gary ve and daily V for the social media Clips not for the long form I even still do podcast as a guests because Dustin's sitting right there decking it and we're going to clip it and there's going to be three or four or seven things social media organic more important than commercial more important than your email newsletter more important than a billboard more important than hiring Beyond say to be in your Super Bowl spot big shout out Verizon more important to anything else if you are not the best in the world at organic social media and the way I Define that as because I know YouTube have been paying attention for a long time is I'm one of the humans that equally has 5 million followers on LinkedIn as I have 15 million followers on Tik Tok I'm talking crossplatform I'm talking YouTube shorts I'm talking snap Spotlight I'm talking Instagram I'm talking YouTube proper YouTube shorts I'm talking podcast I'm talking newslet I'm talking for real for real and so yeah I mean I think it's just a fun time to be on this show because you were saying right before you're so sweet like I love you guys like you're like what's a win for you Gary I said whatever is best for your audience right now right and you said our audience is starting to figure out that like everyone could be an influencer and I said [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man you couldn't even imagine how that hit for me I'm like I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sat and wrote this book in 2008 and and I wish you knew how nobody believed me not my publisher not my Ghostwriter not my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not the audience people [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go look at the Amazon reviews when I first put this out literally people wrote things like this snake oil salesman's trying to tell you you're going to make $100,000 a year on YouTube what a joke think about what a joke that comment is now I think people they're scared of the unknown and it was the unknown and what I like about you personally is that you always go for the unknown everyone is so scared of the uncertainty and the unknown and what they don't know and they don't like it and they fear it so they hit against it they don't like change either right and then other things that happen especially for influencers and creators is they get good at something and they want to hold on the reason so many people [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the Tik Tok moment was they got a million followers on Instagram and they wanted to stay there because it felt cozy cuz their ego liked the blue check mark and the million followers so they didn't start setting up shop on Tik Tok because they didn't want to start at zero I get fired up to start at zero I'm pump like you know like it's true like I love having 60 people watching me on Twitch right now while I stream from my office on mute cuz everything is private information and all all my friends how many people are watching 60 like I'm just just putting it on to test 42 like 28 like you know but could I get more sure as Dustin knows like if I go on Instagram live for two seconds and say come over here to that's 400 but like I'm not clicks I'm not Booga I'm not kaiset I'm not Aiden Ross I don't have the time right now to sit in front and stream for 15 hours a day do I think I could do that well I sure do I think I can gab with audience for 15 straight hours and Crush but that's not in the cards for me right now I'm operating I'm building an enormously big IP called V friends and I'm building the biggest advertising agency in the world yeah I'm busy and that so when I saw that as a full circle moment I was like oh okay there's a way to do this long form content and go and speak and do all the things that we all do but you can still be a great operator and and and this just reinforces the main thing but and and you know there's a lot of people out there selling a lot of stuff I'm sure you know and you know get rich quick schemes and what to do and I was I'm like if they're just selling you on the idea that like they're selling you on something and they don't have the actual infrastructure you got be my my biggest argument in marketing right now there's a lot of marketing professors and pontificators I'm like if you're so good why doesn't your book sell like this you know to your point get rich Crick all we all know that that's played out like people still get away with it but like people are getting smarter that and they're not as loud and as noisy as they used to be yeah it smells there's something that smells about it it's just a simple question like if you're so good at marketing why doesn't your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sell right like like every author that writes a marketing book that the book doesn't crush is a weird situation like like if you're supposed to be so good at marketing why doesn't your book sell what would you say to someone I can't wait to hear what you would say to someone that says I'm too busy to create content because you have 60 million companies I'm looking at this list guys I'm going to I'm going to read it in in the beginning of this episode going to take half the episode yeah please don't do that please go on what you would say to someone I'm too busy to create content you don't believe in demand creation what does that mean you don't believe that creating new customers or consideration for what you're doing is important so they just want to appeal to who they have do you know companies that are really great at sales what they're also bad at at marketing and branding if you're a sales organization that means it's not coming to you you're going out you're going out and hunting right it's I love sales and I love when companies do both yes but if you're only about sales it means you don't know how to Market in brand because when you know how to Market in brand it comes to you right so when I hear that I'm like oh that person doesn't understand that content on social networks in April of 2024 is the single most important thing in the world to do great to get people to come to you versus you go chasing it they're too busy often times operating and selling when if they understood that branding and marketing would accomplish the selling and free up time to operate Vayner media doesn't even do rfps anymore this is very nerdy marketing talk the request for proposal we don't do it we don't need to give me the business because you know we're the best that's a good game it's a lot more fun when you go out to the club when it's coming to you versus you running after it yeah because it's not there's no desperate energy no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah that's what you want by the way that's what you want with men of course that's what you want when you're being chased as a woman I think come to me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of course you know what too I also like personally I think Lauren and I both realize we're really bad at the appro we're really bad at the sell me too by the way I don't like selling either I really don't like it it's why I like marketing and branding so much like it's even think about what just happened in the meta here Gary what would be a win for you ah let me do branding let me bring value to the audience then of course they're going to want it the kids book then of course they're going to want to buy like I don't want to what am I going to say buy my book like no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like when people go do the Today Show or podcast like when they I'm like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are they doing no the audience what do you think nobody understands like you go do a podcast you have a new book coming out what do you think they want to happen of course you'd want your book to do well for me my book's going to do well there's no scenario where my book is not going to do well and why is that and how is that from a micro level like how do you look at it when you are ready to to launch a book how do you look at it as opposed to I look at it at this point as do I have something to say that's going to create more of you too the reason day trading attention is fun for me I don't know if you've gotten to skim it or read it yet okay it's because even you two that are winning There's real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in there that you don't know oh yeah by the way I have all your books the it's not just this book it's all your books that's anyone can open your book and highlight I write books on the concept of marketing and branding and the current world that are good for even the people at the highest levels which then of course is going to matter for the people that are just starting out which was the waitress you yeah I write books that both will crush for you when you were waitressing and Crush for you right now in the midst of you building your Empire you know how epic that is for me you also don't WR books for money well sure but that's sure I think it doesn't feel like that of course not it's not enough money in it for me right but it seems like you do it cuz you I want to be historically correct and I want to impact I want I the intoxicate to me a billion dollars isn't intoxicating you two looking at me with the admiration through your four eyes is the intoxication admiration is a drillion dollars has it changed over this two decades it's always been the same it's always been the same it's always been the same it's always been the same my favorite people to interact with are the kids I grew up with that knew me for real for like you know everyone now is like oh Gary you're you're not you're you're it's it's different now cuz you got the money I'm like you don't know me you don't know 27y old me that was exactly this person making 61,000 a year well I do want to say something else to you we've been swimming in the same waters for a long time now and with that and you know this too you get to meet a lot of people and everybody talks everybody knows each other yes and not only do we know people that you've partnered with but we know people that have worked with you and for you and of all these years I've never heard anyone say a bad word about you she just ra sing your praises today and I mean that as a real complex yeah yeah I mean it's it's how I live my life I couldn't imagine Dustin Lara Sam Hees D like any like I and by the way even sometimes when people leave when it's a little murky maybe I wasn't canderous enough that's why I wrote 12 and a half to talk about the only Kryptonite I think I've had in people relationships was I wasn't canderous enough to some people what is canderous I couldn't deliver cander I couldn't be like hey Dustin I need you to do that like if I love you but Gary ve is the most cander yeah on stage in a podcast in book form Crush cander Gary Boehner chuck if I like you and you're not doing a great job at work I dance around it so how does that then what what do you think the impact of that is it created sloppy exits 99.9% of people are going to say remarkable things about me the 0.1 that could be like ah I couldn't tell them they stunk and I surprised them when I fired them and so they had resentment towards me and so that that stings because what you just said that what you just delivered is everything to me the way people that actually know me actually spend time with me actually talk about me means the world to me but I think it's it's important because again like coming up and figuring this out and it's it's very fast-paced and there's a lot going on especially in this world like I don't think especially a lot of young people starting here they don't realize like this can span decades especially if you're building something on a personal brand and you have to not only protect the business but you have to protect your reputation in the way you are with people because you never know that becomes the executive what you're alluding to is a lot of people look up to a lot of people but 88% of them are pieces of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah yeah I yeah exactly and people are hypocrites and they talk about being nice on camera and then everybody works for them hates them yeah or you meet some people and you know once you get in the circles you get to the truth well and you podcast with someone that you think is the best and you see the way they treat people in the office or the way they treat their own and you're like oh that's so it's so like devastating Meet Your Heroes yeah sometimes I mean some are great agreed some are great 88% versus 12% is a disappointing thing for all of us I'm disappointed too a human the Creator side right you start to see people that like are starting to kind of make it and they're getting the traction and then all of a sudden they start to like believe their own hype and they start of course humility is the missing ingredient for almost everyone because most people are grounded in insecurity versus actual confidence talk about that well like the reason I think I'm nice is is because I'm confident it's not super comp complicated most people have bad behavior from their own insecurities where do you think that comes from with you because the luck of the DNA draw in Epic parenting my mom crushed it but I also know that I have siblings and cousins and friends and I I have I have children I see how PE I see how the world works it's not just parenting it's not just environment like I got very fortunate that it was part of my DNA and then it got reinforced by a mother who really believed in kindness who instilled that I was the best so I believed her but not that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] delusional you're the best you're the best she told me son but then when I did things wrong consequences modern parenting has [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up it's why I wrot MIM me in the middle if you if you tell your kids they're the best that's awesome if that becomes delusion and you don't have ramifications and consequences for their poor Behavior then they become delusional they get give specific kind of entitled delusional it it it's a fine line yes the entitlement in our society in First World countries like America parts of Western Europe Rich China and other places is a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cancer do you get pushed back at all at this point in your career like there was a we did a episode one time on hustle culture and it was like a big like a hot button issue and you know our perspective is you got to put in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] work like you you have to I think I think you know what happened there in my career was somebody wrote a medium article called hustle porn and put me as the I didn't know if they did happed and so what happened was there was a moment there that it got a lot of heat and I started but it was easy for me two things happen with that one the most remarkable thing was I talked about it once on a podcast and because there was so many things that weren't true about me in the article and I said that I felt bad for the person that wrote it not for me and then that person reached out to me recently and I sent it to Sid and Andy because it was a big moment on our team Gary at the time and he apologized and said I was right on the podcast I know that used me and then so for me that's what actually sparked people throwing me into that combo because if you read crush it I don't talk about working 18 hours a day I talk about having the capacity to work 18 hours a day when it's your hobby when you love it do you understand that I would not work one hour a day if I didn't like it I got D's and Fs for a reason I did not like school and I believe that I'm part of a very rare Club as a matter of fact Gary vri.com if you're part of this Club cuz I know there's not that many people so I don't think my inbox will get flooded don't email me otherwise please I got too much email but if you're one of these people email me are you part of the I never opened my book I never did a single piece of homework and I never studied for an hour or more in your entire four years of high school please email me because you and I are part of a I am an alltime remarkably poor student from freshman year to high school at North hund in high school in hund in in New Jersey I did not do one piece of homework in four years of high school I never submitted a book report I did my Scantron as ABCDE like complete random and I never studied once not an hour in four years of high school my capacity to work hard when I don't like it is zero my job my career is my hobby I treat working the way people treat skiing and vacationing and cooking and watching Star Wars and playing video games it is my great hobby so when people tried to throw the hustle thing at me I was like the receipts exist go watch my content I don't work 18 hours a day to make a million dollars for what so the real message is that if you can turn your work into something you absolutely love that becomes your hobby then it doesn't feel like works so you're not really H you're hustling but you're not really anyway because it feels when people like Gary work like I just said this on another podcast first time I ever said this way I'm like they're like yeah but Gary I work 9 to5 I have great work life balance I'm like do you like your job nah I'm like you don't have good work life balance you have 40 hours a week that you were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] miserable I also disagree you do have to hustle like what do people like not not disagree with you disagree people are mad about we are fully agreeing that becomes let me tell you what that's about that's Sim that's similar to why cancel culture is getting canell that was the manipulation of a word when the word hustle meant hard work we all agreed on it what happened was Society manipulated the word hustle into work so hard in such an unhealthy manner that you will get sick or suicidal all for the chase of money yes my definition of hustle is hard work is one of the ingredients to make something happen that'd be like saying to everyone good news you don't need to go to the gym or eat right and everything is going to be awesome physically not true sure so that was just the the slang word of H this is why this is the biggest issue with cancel culture it doesn't f in intent yep if somebody makes a misstep but they didn't want to and they like you and they didn't mean it why should they be fired and eliminated from societ it was so out of whack which is why it didn't last long there's a reason we're having a correction and and and why it was just a blip it was it's not sustainable it's not right yeah it's why like honestly we never I mean and again and I think it comes with having like a lot of people in that moment were may be new or just getting started finding their foot we've been doing this for so long now as long as you but that it felt like a blip in time and I kept looking like this is there's no way you can sustain this way and people would get frustrated that we wouldn't take it more seriously but I'm like it's it's not something how are you not allowed to by the way I stopped using hustle during that time and just used hard work and work ethic you want to cancel work ethic knock yourself I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what they want to cancel it has nothing to do with me yeah here's the problem with life right now everyone has such audacity that they think everyone should see the world the way they see it oh please I have deep conviction of how I see things I'm me I'm Gary ve I write these but when I tell you I totally understand why people don't see it the same way I have conviction that organic social media is the single most important starting point to marketing I equally spend my career 7 hours 10 hours a day because I split it between be friends and bner with people who think a TV commercial is the most important thing I think I'm right I think they're stuck in yesterday but guess what I'm not mad at them I don't hate them I don't think they're stupid I think they'll be proven to be wrong I don't think in 2024 spending $4 million on making a commercial for television on a non-streaming service on network TV or cable is a good idea I think it's actually the stupidest idea but I'm not mad at anyone if they see it differently what's a bad day look like for you one of the things I'm struggling with right now is that with 2,000 employees and I'm so HR driven the pet team the people and Talent team always tell me when something bad has happened to an employee anywhere this is a big part of me wanting to be the human CEO I am to the point where I'm actually debating maybe not doing it anymore because now at 2000 when it was 50 people 80 people and everybody who's 22 we were cruising nobody's parents were ding everyone was 22 nobody's parents were dying nobody lost a baby nobody had like we were cruising I was like this I'm the best like like meaning I'd have to hear about it once every few months and I would lean in now at 2,000 people many of which are are 40 50 30 things happen people's siblings die people's parents die people lose a baby people get sick people themselves get sick and hurt we had a we had an incredible teammate get murdered murdered in Brazil like Columbia Columbia so the weight of a day-to-day negative thing of people I care about that work with me heavy so bad day for me would be getting bad news about somebody in one of my companies that's happen to them because I I'm very emotional and so I take things on I'm able to coraliz I can that's what I'm great at I can deal with it but I would tell you my bad days are only left for cancer death terminal illness car wreck burnt house down losing money somebody saying I stink like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I want you to talk about that a bit because you've said that for a very long time and I think a lot of people starting out with that perspective you know some people get and as we've become parents and been married and all this I I really like lean into like same Theory like if something happened to her or my kids like that's a real thing look you're you're losing a little money like even let's go to the full extreme you guys are really in it right now you're on the pressus of building your Empire right what if it went to dead zero tomorrow devastating you've worked really hard I'd figure it out of course that fig you have to have that you have to have that you can't you can't be scared you why cuz you have no choice right like I don't understand people think they have optionality to step backs everyone's so scared of losing they've lost everybody is so scared of losing that is listening to this right now that they've already lost because of the fear of losing what about the forever student oh right like they just read about it and never do about it yeah I mean they're the forever student like I don't know like I was that about health and wellness from 28 to 38 I was talking to myself for a decade about I have to get to better shape I have to eat better [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I have all these goals and dreams I'm not going to live to 100 if I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if I keep eating [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] never go to the gym and then at 38 and a half I finally got serious about it and I've started taking my my health more serious over the last 10 years of my life that's how I feel about all of it I I understand the forever student I was it with my health and wellness from 28 to 38 it's about fear it's about I used to say when I was 34 that I didn't have time to work out 34y old Gary compared to 48-year-old Gary with time that guy is a puss why is he a puss it's not that I work that much more or less my efficiency is like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gangster do you know what my calendar looks like no can we see it yeah I this is my dream this is actually my dream to see your calendar this calendar watch this my calendar is super early and look at this 15 minutes 40 minutes 30 minutes there's no lunch there's no there's no you've always done it this way yeah uh-huh huh you guys know like 4:45 to 5 5:15 to 5:30 4:30 to 4 like it is wa do you have something in there that's is 445 to 446 it's like it's like it's very real to me like shower in there my efficiency me learning as an operator that every one out here's a big one for all the entrepreneurs out there every hour meeting you have is actually a 30-minute meeting please can can you actually talk about that from a very detailed I need all these the reason I have so many 15minute meetings is almost every 30 minute meeting is actually a 15-minute meeting but you putts around on dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that doesn't matter or pleasantries that aren't required at that moment like I'm so excited this is great how do you and and like eating the pineapple for a few minutes and like making a coffee and all of a sudden it's like 209 let's do here's my favorite one 13 people in a meeting let's do intros for a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hour no I mean like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I give you an example I had I was speaking to some banks the other day and they the they were trying to schedule hours every time like no 30 because the point is like on the hour everyone does the round of introductions how was the weekend and you also lose momentum in the conversation it's like let's just get to the point what it's like going to the gym for an hour but not doing a single exercise properly you don't have to hard stop it because people get to point I want to know how you get out of 12 to you do say I apologize I have to go to my next meeting just straight up you're also in my role as I'm the conductor of almost every meeting like everyone don't forget it's also scheduled from 12:00 to 12:15 people see it people know right you know like I don't know like show up ready yeah like I'm like listen I'm I'm bad at interrupting when I'm the podcast host I'm definitely gonna interrupt in a meeting if we're trying to move [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] along so you're like sorry I have to go to my next meeting bye I mean it's even weirder than that I think back to the point I'm making which is if this meeting is 12 to 12:15 at meeting is two minutes long like there's no like it's not like someone's gonna pontificate about anything like I don't know okay I'm gonna I'm gonna take those 15-minute meeting tips and it also what I what I like about seeing your calendar too is you can tell you've also carved out time that's personal yes of course now I don't do a whole lot of personal between like 9:00 am. and 700 p.m. like I'm like a a minimum day for me is 10 hours of operating no lunch I barely go to the bathroom it's 10 hours right um right every day every day every day and by the way that's the minimum there's plenty of 8 AMS to 11:00 p.m. and all that listen I love what I do but I'm in or I'm out like on the weekends I'm seea vacations see you Jets game double seea like you could tell me the world's burning down I'm like this game's not over yet you know like like I I carve out that time and and I've definitely evolved and it es and flows with your personal life of like there's times where you could triple down on work there's times like you find different variables in different chapters of your life there's no Su I also have no ideology to my work ethic like I'm also comfortable changing my mind tomorrow and never working again it's a fluid situation like it is what it is I focus on one thing enjoyment satisfaction happiness and currently this is working but if it changes it changes so when people come to you at this point and you've talked to thousands of people and they say Gary I'm not happy with what I'm doing I don't like my bid I you I'm not I don't know passion like what is the what is the main theme that you're recognizing with those people and what is the response to them lack of accountability or optimism um and they're looking for answers but often what they're looking for is affirmation for their excuses and the reason they like me is I don't want to do that for them because everyone else is doing that for them and it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] them up what most people want is for you to agree to why they got unlucky or why it's not going well if you look carefully at what's happening a lot of us are creating entitlement and nepotism for people we love by acknowledging things that aren't true like for example the thing that's really playing out in society right now is the real pandemic is non-accountability right so right now you have an entire let's just use our country for a little bit it's Biden's fault it's Trump's fault it's Republicans fault it's democrat's fault it's my spouse's fault it's Mom now the other big one it's mom's fault it's dad's fault it's everyone's fault what about this like the thing that I'm usually trying to be like usually where I go depending on the tone and tender of the person you know some people love a a a Gym trainer that like really grinds you like go you like people like that other people like one that's a little bit more like your therapist SLT trer everybody likes different things from different relationships what I tend to try to do is look at the person that's coming at me whether randomly at an airport or somebody I really care about and be like what style of communication can I give right now that brings them the most value for some people it's like look that's real trauma like somebody comes to me that I don't know and like this happens to me a lot like that I don't know them but they consume my content and I'm like in line to get a coffee and they're like Gary can I speak to you I'm like you know I'm pretty me I'm me I'm like sure they're like look man like my dad was an alcoholic and like sexually abused me I can't be like yo bro who gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that's not appropriate you need to come with real compassion in that moment that's something I can't fully understand I'm not all knowing I'm like to me that needs extreme sympathy and passion but and compassion but if that's a 45 minute convo not a one minute convo then at some point the the the story with that person especially if it's the 18 it's let's say it's an employee and I'm in hour 18 over three years with them at some point in that combo it starts to transition into like you are aware that other people have also gone through this traumatic experience and through therapy meditation health and wellness mentally and emotionally physically they've been able to get on the other side humans are remark able now how you start that conversation isn't always like Rah rahah I got you sometimes it takes four hours of compassion before you can start to transition the energy to accountability and capability but the ISS you know what do I say you're capable you don't like politics is such a Hot Topic right you don't like what's going on in America go Sweden I don't know like if you're like if you're so distraught right now listening to this and you think America's the worst I have great news Australia is lovely yeah and so to me why are you going to complain when you're in control ah you like that feeling people don't want to be accountable I think complaining gives people sometimes an identity it it gives them a short-term endorsment hit it gives them a short-term excuse it gives them a Band-Aid it gives them a jolt of I don't suck this is life is as basic as it comes insecurity self-confidence everything else is secondary yeah it's it's interesting too because like the message is very clear and I and I couldn't agree more but you know there's also this thing like well easy for you to say Gary ve point of privilege laor and Michael point of privilege and like it's it's just like it's another bum only because they don't have context of course sure easy for me Gary let's talk about Gary I immigrated from the Soviet Union I grew up in a household where my dad worked every minute where my mom starting who's the Great L of all time but very early on said you take care of your sister I've only had responsibility I've only had stress and pressure on my head my whole life started working my dad's lior Store at 14 at 16 I'm already a financial impact on the business now I've got that like I've only had and I've never had a vacation in my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] life how about that I didn't take one as a kid and by the time I was grown and I went every vacation I've ever taken in my entire adult life I've had to think about responsibilities that were happening while I was on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] beach so I promise you I wasn't on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] vacation yeah that's one thing thank you enjoy like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you how about I'm how about you fourth kid in your family never had the responsibility everyone took care of you in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] family you got it good you're the oldest right yeah yes like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like as if nobody else has like everybody has something everybody has something the thought that that I have it like the thought that other people have it better than me that is stupid why would anyone think that you don't know about people's lives you know how many people have had atro things happen that they've never had the strength to say out loud nobody on Earth knows there's everyone's walking around with Secrets everyone has skeletons everyone has trauma everyone has pain like like no I don't think it's a point of privileg plus what are we defining as success that's the thing the stupidest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing I know on Earth is that people Define people of privilege with money money has no correlation to happiness you know un you guys are grown now you're in circles you know unlimited amount of people people we know with money are more unhappy than people % and by the way you don't know yet you'll find out if you get there and if you don't get there you won't know like I don't know like am I supposed to think LeBron's lucky because he's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] athletic freak I know that I wasn't born as an athletic freak but I don't know what's going on in LeBron's life like I'm supposed to believe that Beyonce has it so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome I don't know what's going on in Beyonce's life how are you going to teach your kids this I want to know for my own like what are you doing that you and this book too you could talk about this as well like what are you doing for your kids you're just having conversations but don't forget I'm not going to be the best vess like there's different vessels I'm going to be my kid's dad I definitely I'm definitely not gonna be Gary ve I might be very effective for your kids right by the way I might be the perfect person for your kids one day you're be like this is somebody we knew for a long time they're GNA think it's they may think I'm cool it's happening right now for so many of my friends they're 15 to 20 year old they're the amount of text I get from Friends saying my son just texted me a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] video from you oh that I've been telling him for n years but he hasn't listened but he texted me and be like Dad we should do this you're like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I've been telling you this because sometimes you need an outside voice sometimes Oprah did it for people even though mom was saying it the whole time I can't be that I'm going to be dad for my kids yeah what am I telling them I'm doing Dad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but I also know that Dad shit's only going to be 50% of it because people humans when they grow up Dad Mom can only have so much leverage on them so I can do dad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there I try to do dad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for the internet older brother [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] The Godfather Godfather of the internet you know like I try to do it I try to leave positive contributions and then I'm also okay if I'm not the right vessel yeah I'm going to be very calm if for the people like I'm comfortable I mean my sister my sister and I are very close she always laughs because I people know my brother I talk about more because I usually talk about business as you to know I don't talk about my personal life a lot yeah um so usually my sister's always like nobody knows we always have my sister your sister's the middle yeah and I grew up with my sister much more than I grew up with AJ how much younger is AJ 11 years I went to college AJ was seven so I now I was also like a 18 going on 11 and he was seven going on 17 so we've always met in the middle but you know my sister I have a real fun relationship with we're Incredibly Close and like she's like what's a gap three and a half we grow together and like we grew up different than AJ AJ had a little bit better because I came to the wine store and blew it the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up let's just call it what it is so we grew up we have we have different stories we we have our childhood together you said something so smart though you said on your Instagram that the way that you look at giving the kids the internet is you want to instill self-confidence into oh you're talking about it yeah I'll get to that in a minute let me finish this thought go my sister even like had an epiphany with me in the last five years like the way she vied me my dad like M like like like and that's like somebody I grew up like so like what I'm what I'm trying to say is that like I I'm humble enough to know that for some people like there's people listening right now that I was literally the guy for literally I was the single human being many people come up to me and say you were my true father figure you are my true Big Brother figure it's humbling I know that I have The Gift of Gab like many billions of people have I don't think that makes me special there's many other people right now on the internet Pro left right everybody people hit with music musicians right like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what do you think like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like it's so fascinating to watch like who inspires who breaks through who gets through your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] head that is something I think you're born with like it's a communication concept right so I'm cool I'm happy with that but I'm also okay when I'm not many people also come up to people most people don't have the guts for this but some people come up to me occasionally and be like I don't buy your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm like okay I'm like first of all I'm not selling you anything not asking anything of you and two like that's awesome like I get it like maybe I'm too high energy you don't like the cursing you don't like like competitiveness to BR that's amazing I'm glad that a different kind of voice resonates for you like usually when I'm met with that normally on DM or comments rarely in person but when I'm met with it in person I always tell them like I hope you do find the person that hits for you for me that was my mom it was never Joe namoth it was never Jay-Z like for me the person that broke through was my mom I think the people that call you out like that though want your attention and when you give them the attention they immediately back down and say sorry I've seen it happen yeah of course and and that's fine too and I'm empathetic to that they just want to be acknowledged yeah of course I get it every listen I I live with compassion and sympathy and empathy running through my blood yeah it is my natural state it's how I see the world I'm so grateful and humbled by the luck of the draw of my DNA and parenting and Circumstance if I was born here and not in Russia I'd be a different person I lived in a studio apartment I remember living in a studio apartment in Queens the size of this room with more family members than are in the room right now six in in the room now do you understand how grateful I am to be able to have a nice dinner Red Lobster on my third my 10th birthday was like going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Europe I wore a suit from Kmart that my mom bought for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] eight bucks for my 11th or 10th birthday cuz we went to Red Lobster I went to one I went to two family vacations in my entire life both to Disney World the first time we stayed in the holiday in not the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] where Mickey Mouse is stayed in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] holiday in how the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] am I not going to be grateful for everything I was fortunate to grow up that way and every time I had nothing I was always happy so of course I live a life realizing money is not happiness we didn't have it and I was the happiest now I'm around unlimited people with unlimited money and they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] miserable you think I'm confused I'm definitely not confused what do you think the common denominator is that makes those people with the money unhappy what do you think that is what what happens to those people they're insecure and they thought money was going to close the gap yeah they thought the pretty girl was going to close the gap they thought the watch was going to close the gap they thought the handbag was going to close the back they thought the ZIP code 90210 was going to close the gap they thought the followers were going to close the gap they thought the blue check mark was going to close the gap they thought the Grammy was going to close the gap they thought the BMW they thought something nothing's going to no is going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] close your Gap if you were emotionally insecure you are vulnerable to you are vulnerable and often times the person that made you insecure was either your mom or dad which is a whole brain [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so say like in your scenario and I think in our scenarios we were all fortunate enough to have parents that like really instilled a lot of confidence and told us we could do whatever we put our minds to so and so we kind of had that but for someone who didn't grow up with that and has those things how do you help them get there find people that do it for you or content that does it for you I watched my father who did not have self-esteem being built into him transform under his time being with me at the liquor store I'm proud to sit here and say I had a dramatic emotional impact on my father and how and how did he manif I didn't know that I've never heard you talk about that cuz I don't talk I'm trying to give you something nobody else has here you go yeah tell us I mean tell us about that I'll tell you I believe that I believe I've never said it because it's not really for me to say but I feel like my father's and I relationship is at the right place for me to say this I believe that my father was sitting here he would tell you that the 22-year-old kid that came full-time to work in that store and really six years earlier than that that over the course of me being with him so much between 14 years old and 34 that I fundamentally changed the way he viewed himself and how do you think you did that for him by telling him the truth what do you mean telling him the truth by when we drove to the liquor store and I could see my dad didn't realize how remarkable what he had done was I'm like Dad do you know how many people come to America with 100 bucks like he was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on himself he spent all his time and energy on what was going wrong I was like what about this by changing his perspective Dustin do you believe that I've had a positive impact on your perspective I know who Dustin was when he started that's no surprise any I think anyone that's in your orbit I mean we know drock too like yeah I mean drock would sit here right now and be like I had a profound change like yes but I think I'm surprised because I have a similar Dynamic with my dad that you had that kind of impact on your dad because that's a different kind of impact that's a different one it was you know look I think it is more unusual for the child to do that for the parent but I also think I'm a supernova of positivity like I I think I'm Different I think I'm passionate about it back then I didn't even know what I was doing I was meaning now I'm aware that I am that person then it was just I was a child I just it's like it's the purest form like I don't know how not to look at everything from a positive practical way did your dad social media back to actually go ahead no did your dad and you was there ever a strange Dynamic when your dad had obviously laid the foundation and built so much but then you kind of came in and ripo it and took it to the was there ever like a weird dynamic of him looking at you being like my son is now like proud of you obviously because of everything but also surpassing you know the kind of oh we could do a whole [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] documentary on it we went from a place of where my father and I competed with each other and had weird Dynamics about it to a part in our life now where he literally walks around Earth every day with a hat that says proud dad of Gary ve sweet yeah and and he brings up something I said to him all the time this is his favorite thing to say well it's not that cute I love it but he also has two other children I prefer my dad mix it up a little bit but like my dad always brings this up he brought it up yesterday when I spoke to him in between meetings in San Francisco he said son it's really nice it said something to my dad one day when we were driving and it was about how Wine Library was going to be the biggest wine store in New Jersey and I said Dad I'm G to build such a big wine store for you and I'm going to be so good at it that everyone's going to stop competing with us because they're going to all know that they're fighting for second place that I'm going to be so good and this is going to be so good and I'm going to build the biggest thing and everyone is going to be fighting for second place because what my dad used to be worried about is what you guys are giving giv me flowers for while I was building Wine Library I was telling the industry in interviews what I was doing I was like the internet's going to win an email market and he would get upset he like don't tell everyone your secrets and I would say Dad you don't understand I'm so much better than them I'm going to tell them what I'm doing but they're not going to execute on it and it was this like really gangster moment when I was like 243 or whatever that was a real I remember it vividly the second I said it it was like o it was like a you know like it was be like a rapper where you have a bar that you just know you're going to be known for forever and it was just me and him we used to compete a lot it was a real challenge because I was building the business and I would struggle with him coming in and being like I'm like Dad I'm doing it now but he's technically like the owner in he's like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man like at the time I didn't understand when I was 22 full-time back from college now don't forget I was there since I was 14 so I've been there every summer in high school and college like I was there a 100 days a year but now I'm there 365 days a year when I was 22 my dad was 44 four years younger than I am now whoa that's weird that's a trip that's and so I was like at the time of 22 i' be like Dad like you're like let me you're good like like I mean the thought like I'm 48 I think I said earlier I'm like in the I'm like just starting like like so you know for my dad it was you know he was thrilled cuz the business went from 4 to 10 to 17 to 25 to 30 like I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] annihilated it changed the course of Our Lives brought it online right is that brought it online that was the whole punch line but he lost his identity as the man and I didn't want him micromanaging because I'm like I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] giving up my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 20s for you because I didn't I also had my own resentment I didn't own any piece of the business and he wasn't paying me a lot I love when people are like don't listen to Gary be he inherited a winery I'm like okay let's start from the top it's a wine store in New Jersey I inherited nothing and as a matter of fact there are very few people on Earth that will give 150 hours a week for 12 straight years give up their entire childhood all their fun of their 20s and work every day to build a business for their parents very few I sit in very rare air when people try to Raz me at don't listen to this guy I'm like you don't know you're complimenting me cuz I sit on a island with very few other human beings it's interesting to watch you and know you for as long as we've known you though when you talk about your parents you get very emotional I do and I look at it as like still to this day making your parents proud is probably one of the biggest driving factors in your life 100% and not only is that true I just love them different you know well that's what I was saying like my dad's 80 now and we talk about this and Lauren's lost a parent and when you start to think oh you're going to lose this business you're have a business that like all that stuff in it pales in comparison like when I think about losing my dad or and I'll get emotion if I think too much or with her or losing her like that's the stuff that like oh dude it's why I'm happy all the time and it's it's why bro it's why I'm constantly happy because you have that yeah yeah because if I woke up today and nothing like when I tell you like even looking at my phone after this interview I'm only looking for one thing is everyone good yeah my life is so simple in all the complexity right the 800 like everyone's like he's so crazy I'm like I'm the simplest I'm the simplest of them all you're grounded in the perspective of the things that are really important and the other stuff is the game of course I have Micro concerns of course I'm in the game right it's like being a competitor it's like you know like when you're playing basketball and like you're like I'm me like I'm in it but like not real life I'm detached from it that's why by the way that's why I'm so pumped about meet me in the middle yeah talk about meet me in the middle I believe every parent that's listening to this that buys this and it to their kids and is also going to be affected by it I am going to build a be friends World be friends is Pokemon meet Sesame Street obviously obviously the nft thing got every like with the hype and everything but it started there but it's a it's an omni brand cartoons toys trade if you go to eBay right now please do this please go to eBay right now and type in be friends and go to completed auctions you'll be blown away trading cards and and squish M it's like I'm buil like by the way back to like I'm doing it again when I was Gary ve but I was is really building bner bner media right now I'm bner media and Gary V but what really what I'm building is like literally the next Marvel Pokemon like I can't wait for everyone in 20 years be like where the and I'm doing it right I'm doing it like I'm telling them I'm doing it right now and yet back to like I told my dad no one's going to do it or no one's going to see it even though I'm telling you that I'm building one of the biggest intellectual properties of all time people don't believe you and that's okay and by the way I might not you don't think people believe you at this point still no still no still no maybe if people believe me everybody would run out and buy you how many vriend series one nfts do you have yeah Michael how many I don't have any vriend series but listen I don't have any n that's right comma if you believe that I was building one of the biggest intellectual properties of all time I should have gone in it should have G and you would know that you should go after this interview and go to openc and buy a vriend series 1 cuz that will be the ultimate collectible that would be like comic book number one so no I don't believe that people you have to go buy it now that he just said I'm sure the has gone up no no no actually it's a great time in nft land everyone's confused about nfts nfts are forever but everybody thinks nfts are Beanie Babies nfts are stuffed animals only 1% of nfts are going to be good let me ask you like this is the wrong analogy go ahead I was explaining someone was asking about and like talking about this and I said okay if you look at the watch Market there's certain perod there's people that love watches love it you may put zero value another person may put a million dollar what art people that buy $8 million pieces of art I'm like I don't even want a poster what about sneakers the thing that everyone go everyone just thinks that nfts are all art all watches 1% of watches are worth money y 1% of trading you know how many trading cards have been made in the last 100 years gillions but but Michael Jordan's rookie cards worth a lot of money what people got confused about is they coupled all nfts into one thing not all everybody was confused not all nfts are going to be worth money the 1% of nfts is going to be worth money because they're going to be digital collectible art and collectibles vfriend series 1 is something I'm going to try to make people give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about if they start by reading about patient pig when they're five by the time they think patient pig is cool as they go up the ladder into comic books and animation and Anime and movies and toys and collectibles and trading cards that made them bring them to the ultimate collectible which is the first one the vriend series one now I better get on openc how do you have the energy every day what are this wellness and self-care no one ask you this I know you sleep a l okay are you like juice like what are we doing here no nothing I actually don't consume a whole lot like I coffee yeah I like coffee but I don't I'm very funny with coffee it's like Full Cup drink a third of it throw it out it gets cold like right d like I'll probably get through one or two cups of coffee a day but I have like nine they're always there you know it's funny back to Childhood I always had tea cuz I'm a Russian family we always had tea around constantly constantly there was always tea got home from school 3:00 in the morning want tea tea not like water like tea was a big thing in Russian culture Russian Tea Room like that kind of stuff so I think something happened that that's like comfort for me I always need a hot beverage around me there are times when I have full cups of coffee and tea I don't even take one sip the concept of it being there is warming to me so yes I I drink coffee but no I think my big ones are sleep's huge that was why I always laugh when people like Gary's going to get you burnt out I'm like I'm the one [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tell everybody sleeping seven eight nine hours a day I've never been like like there's moments to sleep for like if you have a big project coming out when vends was going I was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not sleeping a lot like I was in it but that's a couple weeks like I sleep a lot but I've the reason I'm good is I've deep peace of mind I'm not anxious like everyone's like I'm GNA cold plunge and I'm GNA ground and I'm gonna meditate and I'm gonna Jo dispenser I'm gonna do all about Lauren yeah and Mona like like everyone and everyone and everyone and I'm like yeah I just already know so there's no like healthy breakfast there's no workout you do every day there's no electrolyte water I want to talk about this for a second I have no idea what that even means I've heard of electrolyte water but if you told me for a billion dollars Gary tell us what electrolytes is I'm like one of the rare marketing thing they came up with to sell more water like there's one thing you haven't done for us yet and that is play couples therapists and what I tell Lauren all the time cuz you know similar to Mona She's always telling me to Prime with all these 18 things and what i' say to her sometimes is like I'm good well You' clearly been do unlike me you definitely been doing the face stuff I've been do I I do a lot of the stuff cuz you're ve he loves his Beauty he loves his Beauty I'm quarter Japanese he's a quarter Japanese he loves his Beauty you're right you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there's the manscaper there's the colostrum serum I will say with some things though I'm like listen I just already feel good and feel happy don't need to do the 18 things that my favorite thing on earth is when I'm working and Mona's reading something and she'll get excited about something and she's like and she's like wait a minute you're already like that like I I I wake up what do you mean on look on the physical things like I will be very wrinkly like my dad I've never done a single thing for my face and I'm so animated I will be a wrinkle monster give you an ice give you an ice roller um I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but so the physical stuff look I I definitely I work out I'm eating so much better I better now cuz Mona is took me to it's not a calories game it's a clean game so I'm putting better stuff in my food in my body yes I'm talking about the mental game the mental game is the game that's what I'm talking about yeah the mental game is perspective like the mental game is self-esteem the mental game is ready the mental game is very simple I'll save a lot of people a lot of time and energy go do you value other people's opinions more than you value your opinion of yourself a lot of people do I know and I'm telling everyone don't do that how how what are some tangible things that they can do don't do that sounds easy but for a lot of people very hard everyone's different for some people it is years of deep therapy for other people it's it's meditation but I believe the secret to what I'm saying is ground founded in one thing how much negative or positive information are you consuming if you are somebody right now who struggles with those insecurities I believe the formula has to do with your consumption of information who is in your ears what is in front of your eyes people love to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on social media do you know that I can't find a single positive thing on mainstream media can't find positive thing on mainstream media that's right of go go read any newspaper any magazine any television show radio show it's all negative people gave us a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we said we don't have t cable television in the house anymore because that I also don't watch people's Instagram story I star only positive content you're on my start you can pick and choose and curate what you want to see I don't buy my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] content is rainbows and Sh sunshine and the Knicks and the Jets and garage sale and like happy things happy things social media exposed us it didn't change us and I can find unlimited positive [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm so grateful for social there are people like you out there you don't get airtime on CNN or Fox it's too positive you're not selling fear you're not selling rubber necking so they need to be mindful about what they're consuming I believe that that is the point and I think that starts actually in a very close place not on your phone and not on your TV I think it starts with your relationships right I believe there are many people that should get divorced yeah that aren't because their spouse is super negative and they're dragging them down I think that before you do that couples there there's other things to do I don't I'm not I'm hoping not people are like okay don't do that don't take me out of context but I believe a lot of people have parents that are 70 that have been negative all 40 Years of their childhood in life and I don't think they should talk to that if your mom is extremely negative and you talk to your mom times a day because you're trying to rehabilitate your mom you only have so much energy and you're 40 now I think you should talk to your mom twice a week instead of four times a day and you should reallocate those hours to maybe your positive husband to maybe your positive oldest son to maybe a positive podcast what you consume dictates what you think it's why the world's changing so fast right now there's so many new voices so many new thoughts so many different thoughts it's why the world is changing I believe the way that people get into a better mental place is by consuming practical optimism not delusional I remember when the secret came out everybody kind of like misunderstood that book they were like if I just sit on my couch and pray for money I'll get money like I don't think I didn't read the book but I was like I have a funny feeling that's not what the book says no no practical optimism I talk about a lot of optimistic things but it requires action when you read the new book I know tell us about that it day trading attention's hard it's like like when people hear me talk about like lots of content and this and you have to know how YouTube shorts works really it's hard same with what we're talking about now it's hard to tell your mom who you've been enabling for 40 years that you need to cut her out a little bit I don't mean cancel your mom I mean regulate it's hard to quit a job that pays you 200,000 a year without knowing your next job but your boss and your co-workers are so toxic it's been draining you for 8 years I don't think that's easy not when you have a mortgage now when you have college bills coming up but I can tell you it's the answer of how to get happier the point is is it all starts with you and you have to take extreme accountability for your own life and look around and and really look look at the content you're consuming look who you're around and actually say you have the power there's not one person's excuse that I'm willing to listen to for a sustained time I'll be there for compassion up front but eventually we're going to have to talk about what are you going to do about it my friends there's a lot of you doing this listen if you're listening right now and you're 35 to 65 I'm going wide you're in the era of where you have to stop blaming your parents for everything here's younger yeah and I'm just I'm being look what I'm doing I'm being very empathetic I'm starting just at 35 I'm that's old though I get it brother and I'm with you but I'm just but I'm going to be incredibly compassionate if you're 35 to forget about the 25 28 year olds you're still kind of like you most people on Earth 35 to 65 continue to blame their parents for what hasn't worked out and what I'm saying to them in the middle of this podcast is hey it's time to let that go and ask yourself what are you going to do about it because let me give you an Insight your parents they had parents too and I love that you love Grandma Fran but grandma Fran's the one who [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up your mom for you to be mad at your mom oh by the way before we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on Grandma Fran I don't know if you know about Great Grandma Gertrude but she [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up Grandma Fran and so like like this lack of compassion or empathy for our parents who also got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and this inability to be accountable for our ability to fix our [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up like you have generational [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] be the one that stops IT or just be a contributor to the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's bothered you your whole life either you're a part of it or you break it yeah you know it's so funny you mentioned your dad was was 44 when you guys were working together and I think about now having kids of my own my mom was 22 when she had 22y old like and you're blaming you're blaming she's doing you're blaming these I was on the bar with my tits out at 22 Jesus you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lucky that your mom was like even responsible kind are no but the likes you yeah of course to think I saw I I went to that bar to think that like we're blaming people that were that age and they were in many cases younger than us for all of our problems later in life it's crazy to me the other yes and and you combine that with where we are now with entitlement at scale where we think everyone should see the world the way we see it when you guys move from LA to Texas oh God oh God is right I am so sure I remember hearing that you know either from are seeing it I'm like oh these poor two are about to get so much judgment from so many because you did it a little bit earlier right yeah and I'm like look everyone's allowed to do like I don't understand the audacity of thinking your opinion on other people's lives are like right oh yeah we got lots of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or like just think about I mean we've done it same people reach out and ask me how I like it and we which neighborhood to live in at this point now we're approaching that 800 of these and we've had people here and here all sides of the political spectrum and it's so funny because we have somebody on the right people get really flustrated we have someone on the left they get really flustrated I'm like listen we just want to listen to people and understand what makes them tick look meet me in the middle and day trading attention is purple for a reason I'm obsessed right now with purple I'm so tired of red and blue every I think I think most are it's such horeshit purple's Royal it is purple is Royal also think the other thing that happened you know what really bothers me the most about the extreme red and blue of our society we lost civility in it oh yeah we're just so nasty and politicians are to blame I'm so upset with our politicians their lack of stability towards each other completely trickled down I think it's such a shame it's such a sh we have to get to a point too where people are able to change their mind that's like we get so stuck in the mud and the opinion you have to be able to evolve your opinion I'm pumped when I change my mind it's amazing I love it I mean it's gross there's no room to change your mind anymore you know what the scary part is people change their minds on things to be fully red and blue I've watched Friends in my circle I don't by the way on the record I don't judge my friends that are red or blue I really don't I'm super purple and I'm like I because I'm purple like I get it I get it I get it I don't like that I don't like that like it it go like I voted for both parties in my whole life like I'm like pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] purple I just hate the idea of like having to pick aide without knowing what the issues are well the part that really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me up was like five six years ago when it was really starting to get full momentum I was like oh people are changing their minds to be red or blue yeah I literally watch people change their mind on abortion or gun control or big issues I know them I'm like I know what you've thought about this I'm like wait you feel the peer pressure to be fully one or the other that was sad the extremities pulled everybody in we'll go back by the way this by the way the 1960s were like this like it es and flows it es and flows I always believe in people think about how many bad business decisions were made because of that as well oh god look business to me is a whole different game guy well here's my thing everyone now asking their businesses to be political is the funniest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I've ever seen please go off on that very off want you to go off on this because businesses are not capable of it of course businesses don't have the luxury of what media governments teachers Academia like businesses have to either live or die it's Merit businesses are like sports like businesses have thousands of employees that see it both ways what would you like them to do when to speak on Texas crazy running this company half Texas half La during the pandemic you're you're in fake Texas Austin is not necessarily Tas Texas Real Texas people will look at their say this is exactly but um but it was funny because you like half the company says if you do this thing we're out the other half of the company saying if you don't do this thing we're out I'm like guys like I'm like everyone could my point of view like everyone should be out I'll start all over I'm not I'm not how I how can you appease everyone knows we've done it I sat down and said listen if you guys like if people got to go they got to go I I can't you know I can't micromanage everyone's first and by the way I also am empathetic to everyone course I'm I'm I'm I get it but like Anyway listen back to meet me in the middle real quick because I really know there's a lot of young parents here and I'm pumped because I think a lot of them will pick this book up my favorite part is when they read it to their kids they're going to have their own ahas we're going to read it tonight to our kids no is that that's not the real one is it the real one have the fake cover one we the fake yeah it's not out yet I don't even have it I was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] how'd you get it I don't even know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in it oh wait there is stuff in it oh it is the real one oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I want that anyway like um I'm so excited to read this my kids thank you very much yeah we'll buy it day trading how many a thousand give to all your listeners listen 40 what are the how listen you what are these books uh hopefully not 40,000 we have 100 listeners now just kidding um we could do a I'm kidding I'm kidding we can do a giveaway no we could do I'm I'm really genuinely jok actually could be fun I'm genuinely joking go Ahad I'm not joking buy 5,000 no no all right here we go day trading attention how to actually build brand and sales in the new social media world what can people who are listening expect what value are they going to express whether they're a Creator on day seven of being a beauty influencer or they're the CMO of cocacola okay this is the modern Bible on how to be as good as possible at marketing I I believe this has a Darkhorse chance of being the signature book I don't I don't know what the signature book of TV advertising was in 1968 when TV had just passed radio like oal V on Advertising exactly like yeah I don't know what it is I don't want to speak as if I do my hope when I wrote it and I think it has a 5% chance because it's hard to pull off what I'm about to say but this book is has the potential to be the true Bible blueprint architect for the next five years of like social media marketing which I believe is by far now the most important form of marketing and advertising and so I wrote it with the intent that if you are literally doing a 100,000 a year selling nail polish because you're making good Tik toks I can win for you if you're the CMO of Coca-Cola or BMW I can win for you and the most interesting crowd you two there now unlike when I wrote crushit even unlike when I wrote jab jab jab there are a lot of people that actually know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on yeah I wanted to write a book for even that set that like I just know that you two and you're in it and I'm watching you from afar and I know what's going on like when you really read it you'll be like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we're not doing that or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's why our [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I already found five things I'm not doing you know so funny you mention I also like I also think that like you get comfortable you even said it you get comfortable on one platform and you want to settle in and you want to get cozy you I constantly want to be challenging my perspective and my point of view and you always seem to do that for me throughout all your books thank you I'm also in a great place of my career right now not only only am I still Gary ve who wrote crush and all that but now Vayner X is huge we 2,000 people it's Global right like we're huge in Asia we're huge in Lam we're huge in Europe we're we're big we're spending billions of dollars in Media on behalf of clients in Social spend more with your media but you know what I mean like like we're going back and for a happy look at it but um we are we are really really in it and I'm at the helm of that so it's almost like my dream of what I wanted to do which was if I'm the emperor like in Star Wars of social media if I build the Death Star bner media that can point at anything and blow it up and that's what I've been doing for the last 15 years quietly and you know what I would say like on a smaller scale sometimes we go and speak to students schools and mostly get brought in to talk about like this whole world we all now live in because a lot of students they just not taught in school right of course um and I I at my stage in I creative I'm looking for books like what do you read That's relevant and it's hard it's hard to find hard but this is very relevant to ready for this so I think in the shower like a son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like it's my single FL favorite place to think but I also take very fast showers so I have like blitzes of like four minute like thinking okay literally this morning literally this morning in the hotel I was like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I need to get serious cuz I knew I was doing today a bunch of book stuff I was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I need to get serious with college professors this is the curriculum book yeah this is the curriculum by way I did a great job with that on maybe jab jab one of my books I went Ham on thank you I don't remember this is the one I'm supposed to I love this from like any stage and even for Lauren and I we will get value from this now and there's not a lot of people you can go to that know their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in this space does that make sense 100% like you can read about a lot of great Executives but they haven't done it in this way and even me who's putting out a lot of good content every day to help everyone good a book I can really sit down and like nail it because you're getting clips of me hot takes quick thoughts but I was able to go platform by plat I mean for example YouTube would explode on LinkedIn organically oh you're right organic clips of this podcast on LinkedIn would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Crush Taylor you listen that like and that's not something I think is top of mine like that's not how people are thinking like this kind of podcast on LinkedIn what are you talking about Gary yes because there's a lot of attention on it there's a lot of young professionals on it and some people don't like social media so the only place you could [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] find them is LinkedIn I'm I'm platform agnostic I can't wait to be on this show in 20 years and say you guys are still doing social media like I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about social media be the next thing I give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about attention where's the attention and one day that's going to be in VR or ar or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we don't even know this just by the way if I wrote books in the early part of my career I would have had a book called email is King right I would have been like searching for search right you know I would have been like like doing like websites are wonders bad words for days yeah I'm putting it out there that one day could be in 10 years but I'm putting out positivity that skinny confidential is going to hire vayer for my product line I love it I'm putting it out there Gary ve thank you for taking time you I'm I'm gonna do a Tik Tok with you

LinkedIn I'm like I got you I and I I remember the first time I did it it was a huge crowd might have been South by southw it was a I just remember it was a big ass crowd 10,000 not like a 100 and I
