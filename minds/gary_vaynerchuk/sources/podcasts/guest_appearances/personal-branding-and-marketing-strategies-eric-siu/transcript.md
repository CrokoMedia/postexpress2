# Personal Branding and Marketing Strategies — Eric Siu

is there anything you can share around a piece of content that you created that led to maybe a seven 8 n bigger deal I made a video on my couch in 2007 that said Facebook should worry about Twitter on a flip cam it went viral to 500 of the right people most of the employees at Facebook at the time which led to Dave Moren asking me to give a speech at Facebook at the time which led to Mark Zuckerberg being in the back of the audience which led to him walking down after I luckily said smart enough stuff that caught his attention asking me for dinner when I already had a flight back to New York on the I but I said of course I'm leaving tomorrow we had dinner it started our relationship and my investment in his company from his parents Stock A year later I've never sold a single share of the company this was four years before its IPO it ipoed at $42 a share it went down to $19 in the first 6 months it's now $500 a share and that was very very good that I made that piece of content attention is the number one asset Gary welcome to the show thanks for having me so first question I have how are you planning on buying in New York Jets how far off are you uh you know I I think I plan on it by building two meaningful maybe three meaningful businesses that I own more so than let's say starting a fund or investing and so the two big ones in my universe are Vayner X the holding company that holds Vayner media and the other several marketing companies in that and then vriends uh the intellectual property company that I started as an nft project uh um and I feel like what I've always planned on with Vayner X and Vayner media was to build a private Equity Firm on top of that so I've always thought about my mission in marketing when I started the company 14 years ago was if I built the best contemporary marketing I thought in Star Wars terms if I built the best marketing Death Star in the world meaning and I used the Death Star you know if you're a Star Wars nerd if it pointed its powers against a planet it could BL blow up a planet so if I could build the best marketing Death Star whether I pointed it towards bottled water or uh a a political campaign or a nonprofit you know whatever I pointed it to if it always did remarkable better than any other way that it could have done that well that would be the ultimate leverage in the business world and private Equity is a is an industry I'm fascinated by because I think it's right and I'm a business nerd the idea of buying something and doing it better it's like fun it's like operations that's what i' love to do but I've always looked at it as they're good at operating they're good at CFO they're good at coo they're good at CEO they're good at Financial Arbitrage and they're all and I mean the best ones the Apollo the cares the the black rocks they're all really bad at marketing and I mean really bad and I have some nice relationship with some of the top guys and gals in the game and what you learn is they understand the Excel sheet of it all they understand a lot but marketing is a black hole for all of them and that is consistent to what I see in the Fortune 500 ecosystem system I get to work with some of the biggest brands in the world and it is very clear to me that the way I Define marketing in a day trading attention and the way they Define marketing is different I've been able to find the middle so that we can work with them but it is my everyday hope that when we work with them that I'm moving them more towards our side of things right I always tell my people at Vayner we get paid to think and strategize for them not only run the media and do the Creative and all that and so all that leads to a long rant of the three entities that I think could get me to the kind of business success that could allow me to fulfill my fourth grade dream is vriends Vayner X and this private Equity Firm that I'm going to build on top of Vayner X meaning the talent from vaynerx will come over and we'll be the first private Equity Firm that creates hyper growth of the businesses we buy not just operational efficiency at 48 if I execute that for the next 20 years at 68 I feel like I'm in then in a position to make that kind of play got it did you always see it that way when you first started oh I mean in third grade or fourth grade when I was like I'm going to buy the Jets I didn't even know what that meant that was just the time when I realized I wasn't good enough to play for the Jets anymore Yeah by third grade big shout out to w shaw and David Johnson and ran Courtney the kids that taught me in third and fourth grade that even though I had good hand eye coordination and a lot of passion I was not born with the god- gifted ability to Juke out or out athletic have size speed or strength to compete at the highest levels and I was a very practical kid by that time I was like okay cuz first second third grade was I'm going to play sports when I grow up fourth grade was like I'm a businessman because by then lemonade stands washing cars had come into my life and then by sixth grade I'm a baseball card ninja like I'm collecting and selling and making like real money for sixth grade 1985 or whatever it was so um back then it was like I didn't even know and then somewhere in high school I realized I took a uturn I was going to take a little bit of time before I got to my own goals I fell in love with I fell in love with my dad's business the liquor store and more importantly I started collecting the emotional thoughts of how much I admired appreciated was grateful and and like deeply loved my parents and by the time I was 16 17 I also had a level of confidence because of the baseball cards in the liquor store that I had real entrepreneurial skill before it was this thing right you you how old are you I'm 37 so you I'm I'm enough older that maybe this will hit for you but like you might have been the era where it first started hitting but like when I was growing up there was no such thing as entrepreneurship it wasn't cool there was no GVS right so like I didn't even know I thought I was going to be a businessman my whole life that's what I said when I got bad grades but I realized I wanted to do something for my parents so I realized in high school I'm going to go work at my dad's store and I'm going to build the living [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of that business for him and that's what I did from 22 to 34 um and I was that will you know I have a very good feeling that when I'm in my 80s and 90s and I'm doing stuff like this I will always refer to that as the best chapter of my career because unfortunately if I'm 90 there's a likelihood my dad won't be around at that point and I will and I'm saying this for all the kids at home right now that are let's say 10 to 20 and feel like they've got it a lot of those kids want to not go into their family business and they want to go and like be better than their mom or dad or they they don't want to deal with the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I will say with this I ate a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I built my dad's business substantially for him I worked seven six days a week constantly and I made absolutely no money 3 to 60 million right 3 to 60 million 22 to 34 years old never making $100,000 a year like working every Saturday like it was retail it was was but but I sit here today and even though at 34 when I started my now career that people know no question at 34 there was some level of resentment lingering it was small 3 four five% of like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man I built this huge business for my dad I have no money like especially once I started like putting up my head and seeing what the world was yeah do you have regret well this is where I'm going I think you're going to like this and I'm trying to be very transparent here cuz I think it may Inspire someone to join their family business that wasn't going to before hearing this and and I think they will meet me in 30 years and thank me for this this is where I'm going to your point at the time I had resentment it was small I'm going to paint numbers 3 4% which wasn't mad it was more like I would ra my dad and I I would Raz him a little bit and he would you know there was a little I can tell you right now now there's zero there's when I say there's zero regret I already at 48 can tell you right to your face it will be the single best decision I ever made professionally now I'm going to get a little emotional th those feeling the fact that I know I have all those stories with my dad it's insane bro I was just with my dad on spring break with my kids it's just the best like laughing on those inside jokes joking about the fights now that used to piss me off and yet I still had my whole life in front of me yes I was 34 and didn't have a whole lot yes I made a remarkably off the charts great decision in that transition of taking my $280,000 in savings and investing in Facebook and Twitter so of course that accelerated things but those two Investments still sit in my bank and everything I've lived on and built I started from zero with Vayner media in a conference room like this with my brother from dead scratch at 34 and had plenty of time to get it done and so what I'm saying because I know this audience cuz I admire this audience that is of your very successful show I'm just going to say it nice and slow if you're good enough if you're good enough if you're great if you've got it if you're a play player in this game of Entrepreneurship the years that you would go if you decide to go help your family business expand its restaurant business or dry cleaning business or whatever you know classic often immigrant but not always immigrant family businesses if you go and give them 22 to 30 couple things will happen one you're going to learn a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pretty fast cuz you're going to be in the trenches of a family business not in a corporation where you're not learning any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] two if you go straight into your game that's epic and I I listen I know if I was born in this era I wouldn't have went into my dad's business the internet would have been too much it would have been too seductive I would have been I would have made millions in high school let alone you know so I think that's real life so I can't sit here and say go into your family business where I know if 15-year-old me listening he's going direct to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] consumer but I do think you'll be happy that you did it even if you get into big fights with your family remember if you don't choose money over to love of your family it will always be okay it's always ego of the family members that's the issue not the money right and here's the big one I was 33 years old let me put it that way I was 33 years old working full-time in a liquor wine store you have time if you're good enough that was my pit stop yeah to do some mitzvah for my family and then uh I've been on my my actual solo Journey since 34 so last 14 years I've been building my world and um I'm feeling pretty good about it cool one more thing I want to hang on the Jets for one more one in the night I have some uh I have a lot of questions but um how do you plan on structuring that deal for the Jets I think because I know that I don't have the financial ability to buy the Jets within the five next five years I'm not spending too much time on it meaning even in the last couple years the NFL is now more open to private Equity invest like the thing by the time I'm ready there's going to be so much change like who knows with the blockchain with new regulation with cryptocurrency with the new world order the brics alliance usern C War Ian like to think I'm thoughtful to know that by the time I'm ready to strike in years the model that I like the model might be $5 from every human on earth or it might be borrowing against all my assets or it made the well there's so many ways you know or I may make the I may meet two or three people tomorrow let alone some people on my mind right now that become my greatest business friends who also might be Die Hard Jet fans and they might be my partner group so there just it's too far out for me to know I just know that since somewhere around 1985 I've wanted to try to buy the Jets I will say it right now on film look at Mark H I mean let's say I wanted to buy the Mavericks I would have never in a million years thought that Mark cuin was gonna sell it this year no way a year ago i' have been like okay Mark's a little bit older than me and boom I know I'm 100% not in control when the Johnson family decides to do what they're going to do I can only control being a great enough business man an entrepreneur to create the wealth creation that gives me a shot I spend 100,000% of my energy thinking about that I don't think about deal structure I don't think about the day I don't fantasize about it and most of all I don't need to actually accomplish it and this is the curveball to the whole thing what I didn't know for a long time until probably my mid-30s even before the whole Gary ve thing started somewhere around then I'm like oh I don't like need to buy the Jets I need to try to buy the Jets and I would say for a lot of entrepreneurs that are list listening that will probably resonate for the pure bread not the people that use entrepreneurship to make money to hide their insecurities I mean for the purebred entrepreneurs that will do it for the game the ones like me that want to wake up at 6:00 a.m. on a Saturday to go garage sailing because buying something for five bucks and selling it for 80 is fun cuz you're an entrepreneur to that guy and girl I think they'll understand what I'm saying with I don't need to buy the Jets I need to try to buy the Jets you're more so talking about it's really respect or focusing on the journey more so than the end point yeah what I first started hearing like it's the journey not I'm like oh like I didn't like it took me a while before like i' heard it over and over again I'm like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I'm Central casting for that yeah even to my love of losing an entrepreneurship I love the game of Entrepreneurship more than I like myself and what I mean by that is I get a sick almost Twisted joy out of when I lose cuz I'm like good learn yeah cuz I'm like and even more than that yes of course no it's like I don't know if you see this I'm getting Goosebumps it's like this sick respect for the game that I like when the game [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me like I wasn't good enough somebody else did it better or I didn't see it it's like being such a good fighter actually I've heard of I think about great Fighters I got to talk to some of these MMA guys that I respect I have to have dinner with one or two the best of all time and ask them do you think it's cool that you got knocked out because you enjoy the fact that you understand why you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up yeah like oh I didn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] see his faint like like do you love the game so much that even at your own expense there's some sort of Joy Beyond just learning M some sort of like ideological respect for the whole thing I respect entrepreneurship so much I believe in Merit so much the reason I loved Sports so much is either you win or lose yeah right you play that's why I love fighting you fight someone's going to win or lose it's a fight that's why I wish every boxing and MMA fight could not end in judging because that's not Merit just let them fight until somebody loses like that would be the ultimate sport in my opinion I like that you mentioned that because we we did an acquisition a couple years ago didn't work out right but it's like but the cleanup of everything and like the The Comeback right it's like oh that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good right for good for you no I I as a m of fact I learned pretty early in aot in this L latest 14year journey I would say it's funny to hear you say that here's a fun thing I try to think about things I'm not doing well cuz I want to talk more about things I'm not doing well but the reality is I'm very calculated so I don't mess up often in business but like two things stand out for me currently one when I invest I've come to realize 50% of the time I'm doing a charity I'm just writing a check cuz I like the person Angel check and it's straight charity and I've got to really fix that because as you can imagine all of those have gone to zero number two I was very bad at m&a early on I was doing little deals it was just fun it was almost like cool and interesting I can't believe I'm buying a all of those didn't work either and I've gotten much better when I bought purewow.com for Bayer X that was already thank God the ninth time I did it the first eight were small enough that I could make it to go to zero but in a weird way that made it go to zero you know and sometimes you have to just go through those and hopefully that means by the time I get the private Equity land in a decade I'll be really good because I've learned these silly mistakes now by the way I have to ask you something so the thing that you just did with the uh you're like by the way I have to talk to a couple MMA MMA fighters so um one of my friends gray asked a question on Twitter he was like um Ask Gary ve about Nick his uh relationships guy yeah can you talk about that is that what you just did there is it like he's going to set it up once he sees this clip or something Nick Dio yeah um yeah that runs through by I mean probably vayer sport so Vayner Sports my sports agency we're very fortunate we rep Corey sandhagen and St mil like we're I'm pretty deep in the MMA world but let's go to Nick Dio I think that uh similar to how I was one of the first people ever to have a drock big shout out drock Dustin's doing it right now like literally follow me around in film I think what I'm doing with Nick Dio is about to become more normalized uh Nick's been with me for a decade um in the vaynerx world I I like the way he moves we speak a similar language much like me he does he does certain things that people don't understand which annoys them and things of that nature but I know where his heart and energy and capability is and I and I feel like and especially in my new state of being more cander I had a great talk with him in Miami recently that I think has really set us in a good direction and Vegas that has set us in a even better Direction so I'm proud of myself being more canderous of how to tweak things like this because 90% was perfect he is he is a VP of relationships what that means is Nick for a living goes out and represents me in the world with people that we feel are emerging often I would say 80% emerging 20% established um Nick is one and Tyler Schmidt would be the other these are the only people I would feel comfortable that would speak to someone like a jack harlo who have a nice relationship with who I admire who I want to help and like he can represent me at the Kentucky Derby with him he can be another liaison of scale I am so busy but I love relationships so I think there's a lot of people who there's a small group actually that will understand what I'm about to say there's some people like myself that both love the relationship thing and love to op operate as you know some people love to operate and they have no relationships and other people are just relationships and they don't know how to operate I do both but right now I'm very deep in operations land between vriends and Vayner X I'm like in it yeah like really in it actually this is a great joy because I'm really not doing stuff my poor PR team's like come on do something I'm like like I'm just busy and it's 15 hours a day operating those two businesses um so he's running around the world sometimes I'm dming someone that I think is cool and they replying you know I'm in a nice point of my career right now especially if they're emerging a lot of them are like Gary ve what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is this real I'm like I make a video it's really me let me connect you with Nick Doo or hit up Zack Owens part of that team as well who's in the office helping me look and watch the current world I have an obsession with the emerging talent I love the idea of like who I was at 23 and I wish there was a 48 year old version of me who would have dm' me and be like I see you it would have met the what me the world to me and by the way of those people that I will speak to on DM and scale with Nick and Tyler and Zach and Ashley and this team that I'm building you know 10% of them are going to go on to be yeah really important Peeps and it's going to be nice to be there from day one 10% of them will go on to become great friends Andor really really great acquaintances 20% of them will be fun to just see at the cliche Formula 1 Vegas or a conference and just like it's like I'm pumped that now that we have this the next time I see you at an airport a confence you know I I I really enjoy relationships and 60% will be ones and D or never happen that's okay but I value that and so I'm I'm allocating Resources with people I genuinely deeply trust because you can imagine that's the most important thing if you have a human represent you and that's what I'm focused on I love that so it sounds like Nick is if I were to simplify this he's kind of your chief of staff for relationships he's that would be a way you could think about it for sure um he's he's just an inner circle human that I feel I when I tell you I don't check in on him of course occasionally like yo what's up like or there's anything cool going on like but like I know he's sitting right now either having lunch with someone yeah I mean look it's a dream [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] job I make fun of him all the time like dude you got the you know um and you have to have incredible trust I think a lot of people listening to me right now would be like wait a minute but then Nick's going to leave and take those relationships and that may or may not be true but you know don't forget Nick has been with me for so long that like that would only be true if I can't deliver for him not the reverse and even if he wanted to do something for himself that would make me happy right and it's all fine I think the world is abundant so yeah uh I I I really I really am excited about it and I think more people should do it I think one thing that's underrated from my perspective with you is you're a pretty good identifier of talent and so so let's use a ROV story as an example so ROV when he first applied to work at my company he wrote an 8000w blog post for as an intern right and by the way for every listening this is preet chat GPT so he wrote it yeah yeah he actually wrote it um and then when he said he was going to you I was like I was like I I kind of want to know the story about how you identified him and and how you identified talent in general I you know one thing that's great about me is I don't want to say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when I don't like know or don't like talking about real talk and such a key dog in my world and just talking to him today and hung up with him this week obviously with the audio book and he's been my writing partner in the last two books I've written the answer is I don't F it's a little hazy to me I I feel as though Sid or Andy Dustin do you know I'm not sure I think it was Andy yeah I think Andy Andy cranc who led my content team who's now the president of vs um I'm 98% sure that he hired ROV and and the way it works in that world is similar to and just trying to get a sense of how I roll once you cross the chasm with me that I trust you you have unlimited car blanch and then I watch it so with ROV it it was he was hired just like many other people were hired but then I sensed month six and I'm like okay this kid's got something so I'm not necessarily upfront right so I didn't I didn't realize it from the interview process I realized it because I'm not good at that anyway yeah I'm actually not I'm so optimistic brother that I think everyone's gonna be awesome yeah I'm a little bit yeah I've got that tree too much optimism so my critical thinking on interviewing is sometimes flawed but I'm remarkable once I can watch you on the field right so I have no idea by resume and I mean none but I definitely know six months in yeah if I watch and with him it was just very clear he was very talented and it's it's I think for those watching it it it seems like you either have it or you don't in this situation like it's a gut thing yeah yeah and I think like I think when you're when you're hiring you're fully guessing yeah real talk yeah for anybody who operates a company they know what is not guessing is promoting and firing hiring is guessing promoting and firing is knowing yeah right and and I think that that is something I've done well with promoting I've done worse with firing because Gary ve the character on podcast isn't on stage epic at cander Gary vaynerchuk the executive is too much of a bleeding heart back to charity investing and I've been overly nice but that used to be my excuse what the reality was was I don't like the cander and the conflict of telling someone that I subjectively think they stink at their job and I also thought it instilled this was my big mistake actually let me go deeper for all the people that I hope this helps I thought it would instill fear hey Dustin I don't think you're a good manager you're too snarky to this I would think like Dustin's going to walk out of that meeting being like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm going to get fired and start like and and that was never like I didn't know how to get to that place I've gotten a lot better at sitting down with people and being able to tell them hey I'm concerned about these things but real talk and I think I've also earned a little bit where I think this will land better cuz I was a kid coming up a liquor store at that point I think I'm in a better place to be able to be like hey hey hey this is not working but real talk fix it cuz this is working great and this is working great and we just tweak this and we're like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Cruising um so I've struggled with that and you know so but but I can tell you that promoting and firing is knowing hiring is guessing and I think people waste too much time hiring I think they think I think too many people have pride I think a lot of people don't fire people because they don't want to admit they were wrong and I'm in a great place with it because I think I'm wrong every time somebody starts and what I mean by that is I know that I don't know I know that we hired him especially if I make the call with a direct report that I feel like it could happen but I don't know yeah you really don't know to like 6 12 months in and as if I'm going to listen to their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] re their uh what is it on a resume I don't even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ref you like I don't even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know the term that's how much that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like oh yes I'm going to call the three people you told ahead of time to say that you were epic that you found in the world I mean I've been bad at references I apologize to everybody who's listening or watching if I've ever been a reference I can promise you I have sugarcoated the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of it right because I usually care more about the person than I do about the business that I don't know about that's just real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk did you know that Amazon doesn't do reference checks for that reason because Jeff basos is smart yeah we look real talk I don't either and neither we don't really I'm sure some of my mid-tier managers do it because they think it's the right thing to do it's only because I haven't done a good job explaining it but like we don't I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't believe it for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm with you too um I want to come back to this in a second but I want to talk about the book too so like look day trading attention right so actually I got a good question so I it's messing to my my my um buddy this morning so he has a 400 million a year uh SAS right and he's like okay Ask Gary here I'm going to repeat it um don't give me the cliche answer for businesses looking to win in crowded markets what are the marketing tactics they should run today that's a great question for him it's 100% LinkedIn but here's the problem that's not that that's a cliche answer it's a very simple answer but let me break it down for him do I believe that if that buddy who has a $400 million SAS business which is enormous um if he has a SAS business his organization is a sales organization yes you can't get the 400 million in SAS without having sales DNA which means it's in direct conflict to how I see the world meaning I think being in sales means you're just bad at marketing I like it much better than when it comes to you than when you have to go sell it Nike doesn't direct Market to me I go and seek it out anybody listening about relationships it's a lot better when it's coming to you than when you're chasing it that's just the way the world works so what I would say to that kind of business what excites me why I started Bayer media why I want to do private Equity is I would look at his business potentially to buy it one day that's what I hope to be in that level yeah 97 out of 100 times which is why I think I have the career I have right this second I'm pretty sure that I see $200 million in Topline growth for your buddy that he can't see M 97 I don't I don't know him um I can tell you right now the n cliche answer to that answer is it's all in LinkedIn now that would be like me telling you if you want to make a lot of money and have a lot of fun and live an epic life become a professional NBA All-Star basketball player yeah right okay Gary thank you for telling me that I'm a B2B business and Sass and I should do LinkedIn no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah Sherlock so what this book tried to attack and where I'm going to your buddy is if he understood and his team understood that if they were making 30 to 40 pieces of creative a day on LinkedIn and understood that the cpms that his math team is saying Gary's full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when they listen to this podcast because they're mad at the CPM cost on LinkedIn because unlike every other platform they have an artificial High floor so unlike all the other platforms that site start at five or 10 or 15 you know minimal cents I think last time I checked which is a while ago LinkedIn starts at two bucks which [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up everyone the problem is for SAS business it doesn't matter that Tik Tok might be 3 cents you're not going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sell [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on there right LinkedIn is high value stuff when you go to a private club that serves high-end food and wine it's more expensive than [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] McDonald's so for a SAS business on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] March 29th 2024 in this exact nanc knowing how to spend media dollars on LinkedIn against creative that will actually get someone who's a CIO or a CFO or a decision maker to buy that SAS product knowing how to do the first second of the video the thumbnail the copy the remarketing knowing the perfect execution right just like training for 18 years and being god- gifted in talent and knowing how to play basketball that is where his growth is and I mean period end of story AKA $400 million AKA millions of dollars spent on LinkedIn between me media and creative but it would work got it so and by the way when you say 40 pieces you're not saying 40 post for day you're saying 40 ad creatives correct so you could do four to seven of those organically you could do some of them targeted as paid media which is a dark Post in the old terminology that people know that you would do against employees of a certain company get back Quant and qual feedback the biggest thing that's missing especially from this audience affiliate marketing math like really good operators the math crowd which is a lot of this crowd that's listening the thing that's missing for them is the value of the art without any direct attribution yes it's killing them yes the reason I'm different than a lot of people is I understand the value of math and art yep and I'm willing to risk a lot of money to find the seven out of 8,000 behaviors in the art side that make the whole thing go right and that and you know this that's what's killing everyone and they all got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in iOS 145 and they're going to continue to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] brand over everything now that doesn't mean now to the credit of a lot of the kids that are listening you know why Fortune 500 land sucks they're brand over everything but they're delusional brand yeah they're like let's make a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] video for $800,000 and run it on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] NBC and you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazies are you nuts running a television commercial campaign leading strategy like the biggest brands in the world do it is insane how much money Coca-Cola and BMW and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all of them yeah like Nike they are throwing beautiful money in the trash garbage yeah garbage they're getting murdered yeah and every it's happening right in front of our faces and no one's seeing it which is why I've never been more excited the reason I wrote day trading attention is for every marketing company in the world to pass it on to every employee for legacy I know how right this book is going to end up being because I'm writing it at the perfect time the cover is purple that cover is not because I'm a Lakers fan I why not I'm just kidding cuz I'm a Nicks fan the cover is purple because I think in terms of the American and UK political systems red and blue mhm the hardcore math kids that are watching right now they're either red or two blue whichever side you want to pick they're red the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] BMWs and the Nikes and the you know kagra foods and SC Johnson Johnson and Johnson they're to Blue right and the game is the middle so I want the ninja kids here that grew up admiring you you know I want them to understand why they need organic social every day every day every day and great organic social no direct attribution Roi and I want the Fortune 500 Executives that happen to be listening to this he kudos to you kudos to you right now if you work at a Madison Avenue ad firm or a Fortune 500 and you're a brand manager or CMO kudos for you to even listening to a show like this cuz this goes to my concern for them they're so delusional so this is the right what I want for them is also a organic social media understanding cuz they're on the opposite side the youngsters are too mathed out and everything's math math math math and the OG brand catalogs how Brands grow crew they're in delusional television advertising land and the actions in the middle can you talk about the ticktock ification of social I mean even linkedin's getting into it now correct yeah when I invested in Tumblr in 2008 I called my brother AJ and said bro I know I told you Facebook and Twitter are going to be huge and they were on their way I said but Tumblr is going to be the biggest of them all and he said why and I said because Facebook and Twitter you follow people and Tumblr you follow [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're interested in and I was convinced and tubler had a $1.1 billion exit you know 12 years ago which was like 40 billion now and it was a great exit but it could have been bigger and I the reason I was so early on musically which later became Tik Tok was I saw the first time since Tumblr what I've been looking for which was if you gave people the things they were interested in constantly forever you know like how life actually works what you're reading what you're watching what you're wearing it's always mapping you social I could tell by then was no longer mapping if you started on Facebook in the 37y old set you were getting stuff still from people you went to college with that you met at one party once and you were like I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about Ronnie Johnson like it and nobody was just like email nobody was like fixing their feed so once I saw musically and obviously it started as teenage young girls predominantly with some guys I was like o this is different and then very quickly I understood what was happening which is why I was so bullish on it on the time and then obviously emphatic about Tik Tok once they acquired it and yelling about it in all my channels back in the day the the tiktock ification is the reference in the book to now every social network work is going to go into a place of trying to service you to the best of their AI capabilities things they think you want to watch which will keep you on the platform longer which will allow them to sell more ads and stuff it makes all the sense in the world yeah it's how everything in the world works and it is profoundly important and why I'm glad you asked me that with my rant on the prior rant which is why organic social media expertise p is the battleground of the next 5 years of marketing whoever is best at it will win let me ask you this um so I debate with my podcast co-host Neil all the time on this um so this is Neil Patel and he's like I'm like he's like you know you're doing all these things so you know was talking to an agency they get they help people get like 100 million 150 million views per month I talk to one person that's paying for it I'm like so what's the ROI of this right she's like I don't know what the ROI is right now right so we started doing this like last month 12 13 million not bad right but for B2B business and then Neil's like dude I guarantee you all the views you're driving will not drive any business right um and I'm like well I don't necessarily agree with that what's your take on it well it depends on if what the views are if the if the views are Bots and the people you're working with are the worst of the worst characters then definitely not real views if they're Real views and they're all coming from like the Philippines or Afghanistan then also again right if they are real people mhm well then this is look and Neil's had a great career yeah but he's a math boy right I'm gonna send this to him you know and and now to his credit like with SEO and SEO like I you know I've known him a long time he's done a decent job building his brand yeah like he's definitely not like many others that like he's actually to his credit let me even show the other side of the pillow he's done a much better job than most m boys and girls of building a brand I would argue with him of like Neil why do you even have a personal brand what's the ROI of Neil's personal brand infinite correct so I think Neil's an easy one for you to debate on this one if Neil believed that that wouldn't do anything then we wouldn't know who Neil is he would be like many of the math kids that sit in the room that nobody's ever met there are math kids right now making real Bank real money in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] SE behind the scenes in Bosnia and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Iran and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Kentucky and they just slay yeah all math and you've never heard of them once in their life yeah but Neil's got his pretty little face all over the place for a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] reason it's because Neil subconsciously or consciously values brand it's why he built a personal brand and so I think that's what it is and I think the I think I'm going to argue for Neil I I'm I'm sure there's a little bit of Brotherly banter in that because his actions have totally contradicted the way you painted that picture because he's been very aggressive in building why keynote affiliate Summit in 2009 yeah if you don't want people to know who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you are yeah we debate this concept of uh you know by the way I bet you Neil and everybody else would agree that purple's the answer right there's nobody who's smart that thinks it's either all art or all math right the problem is there's a lot of people who think it's all math all art and that's the opportunity for us purple people yeah eaters yeah you can't uh you can't it's there are some people that speak in absolutes and I think that's a that's a severe disadvantage I do too I also am a big fan of the learnings of the art and the math math is fun like you can run it you're like okay this didn't work $32 CPM $32 CAC this one does work $6 CAC right $4 CPM but what people are not as good at and you read the book or you skimmed it no I I've I've gone through I've skimmed it yeah yeah of course you're busy did you capture the part of PCS post creative strategist the people that read all the comments and the qualitative feedback or not yet no I've heard you talk about it though so the thing that I'm in love with so obviously math super easy like here's what you paid here's a conversion CAC LTV CAC LTV you know all that I am really deep in something called PCS land post creative strategy after creatives out all the qualitative feedback of the of the comments at scale right the reason I'm so right about a lot of stuff that emerges is because I read it but it's not in a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] recap newsletter from me or you MH it's in the earliest days in the trenches and that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gold and that's the math around the art so why I love to do things like you're doing is you learn from it too I have no idea if those 12 million views are going to lead to anything I also know that one of those 12 million views might be the future acquire the entire business right this is why I like running ads on LinkedIn so much I can target employees of companies so that means I can Target hedge funds yeah you guys go hard on that I'm obsessed with L of course look vayer Vayner media is Vayner X is a $350 million year R we have 2,000 employees we're a big company we do a ton of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] um yeah man I'm like look I think the thing that I'm most proud of at 48 and being in this game is I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] practitioner you know what I mean yeah I'm not in my Ivory Tower talking that I used to do and trying books anding Keynes like I'm I'm on hands on keyboards Real Talk watch this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] literally literally write the copy to my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] post how many people are in the room now in my team yeah cuz I roov used to tell me it was like 50 people or whatever I think we trimmed it down I think it's like how much is in here right now 25 got it you know like just so everyone knows that's his brand Team CH yeah and the reason it's 25 for 50 a lot of them now are in Vayner X yeah right like we train on our team and then you figure out who they are like uh big shout out let me give her some roses aby's last days today right she's amazing she's going into Eva Noam like production company for post- production so like team Gary's a training ground for a lot of people that then go into Vayner X or other things there's people on befriends there's people at vayer sports it's like a very all in the- family old school kind of world yeah and actually that brings up a question I had so it seems like you're still very involved with all the content that you're putting up period the content the operation like like like people ask me all the time it's so funny when people come to Vayner media bro like people especially with the Knicks and like like they're like what is this yeah like I'm like they're like like people literally sometimes come and visit that we meet in like DMS or something and they think I'm a motivational speaker MH they're like what is this I'm like this is vay or media like what is vay or media I'm like what like I'm like you know but I do understand because I don't overly I mean I promote Vayner media nothing in my Instagram and and Tik Tok and that's where people consume so much of me so I get it but um bro I'm so involved and and by the way I'm too involved but I'm too involved for people that would analyze it if they were trying to help help me extract the most money but I'm trying to extract the most Joy right I'm involved because I like being a COO not just a CEO and definitely not a chairman who's just going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know our contemporaries who've made it yeah I just don't I don't look at a 30 and 40-year-old who is just on the party scene and skiing and on yachts and like speak like I I by the way I'm not confused why that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] epic yeah and especially if they're single like there's a lot I get it but it's not for me I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] operator I love that and you know what's interesting um there's a Zuck video recently where he was talking about how he doesn't in delegation how it's overrated and then you know he doesn't mean that completely but he's basically saying you got to be involved yeah and and I don't I didn't see that but what I can tell you for sure I think at the highest levels what you get really good at it's always come natural to me and I I know it's a foundation of my future success let alone my past success and I definitely see it in others that I can get close enough to that I'm like okay they're doing the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if you focus on the things that are the highest value and you like not just the highest value and not just what you like that crosssection yeah of highest value and you like well then it works I love selling yeah so if I'm I'm if I'm heavily involved in pitching new business now big shout out to kayin mamero who's crushing for me now and helping me scale Sean Walsh like it's starting to happen AB Bradshaw but if I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get involved in selling like it's going to work we just l a $20 million client it's good that I was involved right and I liked it and it was good and that's good yeah of course someone could say like Gary what do you like I mean I really have very successful people constantly yell at me like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you doing right what do they say well they they just if they know me really well they're like bro you like could be making a lot more money like like why are you running the agency I'm like well it's the operating system they're like you could do that now you could raise $500 million tomorrow like you're you like I'll give you $10 million for the I'm like yeah but I'm not ready you're like what do you mean I'm like well all those people I just gave shout outs to like everyone's getting further along Dustin's stronger today than he was 24 months ago you know like I'm building people and like and I'm young mhm bro I'm 48 yep like like i' I'm going to work for next 40 years minimum and like I'm pretty sure to the end and you I know I can die tomorrow but if I don't which is more likely I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] build and so like I'm not in a rush and everyone's like 25 and like I don't have figured out I'm like nobody 50 has it figured out what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you worried about yeah you know so what do they say they're like look you can make a lot more money doing different things I'm like I'm aware I know what hedge funds are I know what private Equity is I know like I get it I know I could start a if I want to go for highrisk high reward I get that I could try to start a SAS business or a or a um a social network I think I could build a huge qsr franchise business like I know there's other things I like this like you're allowed to make less money for much more joy even at high levels like when people talk about like oh don't choose money over happiness they always think of like like a guy backpacking in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Peru no no I'm doing that right now you're happy but I'm also making real money yeah but like yes I'm aware I can make a lot more money but I don't want to dick face I want to be happy why would I want to be miserable and make a hundred more million dollars a year why would I want to do that right who wants to be miserable this has been my whole rant for the last seven years as my content evolves I'm like okay I understand if you don't have money that you think money is the answer but I'm telling you right now I know unlimited you already know at this young of age in your circles how many people are deeply hurt and dark and miserable with plenty of money too many too many yeah the end as many as that are miserable and sad without money money is not the variable of happiness I know everyone who doesn't have it doesn't believe it and it makes sense to me why but will find out if you're lucky enough to get there you know what's interesting um I think back when you started vayer I think this I'm paraphrasing here so it sounded like uh zck was like why why are you doing an agency right and then so I talked to um the founder of WP engine yesterday and as he was talking it clicked for me because I realized you know obviously I'm talking to you today he's like you know what works for me is like agency and like what works for other people might be SASS and what works for you is like agency so like do that it's not like it's within your skill set so do that yeah and mine was even we weirder I don't really think that what I do well is agency I knew I could do it mhm I knew that I wanted to build the greatest marketing death star of all time there you go I also knew that for me to do that I needed to go through it meaning at that point in my life I probably could have raised $50 million to start vayer instead of zero but I also know I would have not learned I would have had too much money and I would have like hired all these people from Ogie and Leo Bernett and droga 5 and I would have gotten nothing but bad behavior and I would have learned nothing I needed to eat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for a decade to taste everything to learn everything to have every [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] battle scar and now I have all the context and now everyone's in deep [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now it gets interesting now they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and let me figure it out and so now and so this goes back to why I always talk about patience I can promise you right now I'm really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happy I did right because I think the problem for you your crew The Crew That's 25 and definitely the crew that's 15 is everyone's just so uncomfortably impatient mainly because 90% want to be successful to fill gaps in their soul yeah right to prove it to the girl that didn't go out with them or Stick it to dad who said they were never going to make it or to their teachers that got dies and that's like my all my teachers told me I was going to be a garbage man I don't know why they picked on garbage men cuz they make plenty of money but that's what was the ' 80s thing of like you're bad at school but like I get why people can build resentment why people have insecurities parent Dynamics not being popular in high school it all makes sense to me I get it but it is what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people up for maximizing happiness and success it also sounds like not enough people are willing to eat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everyone wants to win but not enough people are willing to eat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's cuz most people are fake entrepreneurs entrepreneurs yeah yeah like it became cool you made it cool I I feel like I feel like I feel like it was going it was gon to happen and to your point and thank you and I I take that as a compliment I happen to be in the right place at the right time like no question but yeah and honestly one of the reasons I take on the responsibility to talk about the things I'm talking about now which is like fix your soul pay attention to your insecurity I take on the responsibility that people do think I'm cool and I'm hoping if I spit real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it might help someone yeah I want to tie in a story so that ties in with this book so is there anything you can share around a piece of content that you created that led to maybe a seven eight n viiger deal of course the I made a video on my couch in 2007 that said Facebook should worry about Twitter on a flip cam remember those you flip you stick it into your laptop it went viral to 500 of the right people most of the employees of Facebook at the time which laid to led to da Moren asking me to give a speech at Facebook at the time which led to Mark Zuckerberg being in the back of the audience which led to him walking down after I luckily said smart enough stuff that caught his attention asking me for dinner when I already had a flight back to New York on the Redeye but I said of course I'm I'm leaving tomorrow we had dinner it started our relationship and my investment in his company from his parents Stock A year later I've never sold a single share of the company this was four years before its IPO it ipoed at $42 a share it went down to $19 in the first six months it's now $500 a share and that was very very good that I made that piece of content not only did that piece of content lead directly to that investment it also sparked the beginning of me building a brand in web2 and be my this goes back to the argument and I don't think Neil fully fully believes it that it's not valuable yeah that single piece of content and my keynote that changed my career yeah the one at web 2 Summit in 2008 where I say Smurf it up yeah and that whole thing that went on Ted's website and got a drillion views is 99.9% of the springboard that led to everything you're looking at right two pieces of content that's why I so going back to the talk this talk about idea total addressable market so people in private Equity like use to addressable market right I love that so idea Tam it's like yeah go go wide why not go wide because people going to know who you are well human personal brand Tam is billions of people usually yeah so why not yeah I aim to be known by every single person on Earth before I die yeah that is my Tam well speaking of large town too and especially I apologize just to give a little nerd talk with AI voice conversion we're here yeah like I will be speaking every language and every piece of content I put out next year money in the bank this voice that goes high and gets raspy and does it all its [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with my Cadence that's insane bro I'm going to crush [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Brazil and my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Portuguese I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] annihilate it I'm going to be massive in Germany I can't wait Japan finally I'm hyped so Tam for personal brands that talk about macro things it's 8 billion yep can we talk about some of those macro things I mean let's talk about so your your Twitch experiment uh experiment how's that going right now great and what is it for those that don't know uh it's going great even though mathematically it's doing atrocious I believe that live streaming is in the same place that social media was in 2014 which was in 2014 everyone knew social was real right it was like okay it was it was real like it wasn't like The Fad that people thought in ' 07 when I was there it was s years later you weren't walking around in 2014 being like Facebook go away tomorrow no it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happened but nobody understood what I was still doubling down on which was no no no it's about to get way bigger by the way it's how I feel right now even right now where people are like trying to ban it and it demonized it and it's all leading to mental health or it's the biggest thing I still think right this second that the business world and Society are underestimating social it is the communication pipe of our world I believe that live streaming right now is where social wasn't 14 nobody here or who's paying attention doesn't realize that like twitch really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matters and that clicks and Aiden Ross and kais sen like like it's happened MH but I think most people don't realize what's coming next which is the live streaming of the mundane and the lucrative nature behind it so I have a feeling in the next decade that we will wake up in 2034 and there'll be people who are live streaming their hair salon like working in their six person six seat hair salon in De Mo Iowa that her or him are going to figure out what I'm saying here in the next year or two or three and are just going to put a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] camera and live stream and for whatever reason they are going to become famous meaning they will make money on Subs they will make money on Advertising they will make money on Johnny or Susan's hair slime merch they will speak they will write a book that influencers like I wrote in 2008 with crushit happened live streamers of the mundane not people that entertain you straight to face while playing video games no no everything lawn I've been using mowing your lawn cooking I'm obsessed with this one I think some stay-at-home mom or dad live streaming their 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 of prepping the whole family for the day is going to be the show I just think it's going to crush and then they're going to get a Kellogg cereal deal and a Tropic Tropicana orange deal and an oatly milk deal and a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] frying pan deal I smell it and so how is it going I am live streaming in my office at Vayner media and vs HQ in Hudson yards New York my table I am doing literally 12 hours a day straight of meetings 97% of them are information that can't get into the world so I am on mute the entire time so the 100 or so people that watch me sitting in my office for 12 straight hours at mute have built their own little Community talking I try to unmute Dustin did a great thing for me and added an unmute counter so that inspires me to unmute a little bit more I'm figuring it out I'm doing it because I like to be a practitioner I just want to taste it I know that I'm not doing it in a way that can really go crazy like my other stuff cuz I'm not making for it I wish I was 2007 Gary and I could just be with them for 12 hours because I have a funny feeling I would have ended up in a really good spot right that's not where I'm at I'm trying to hack I'm hoping that something good will come to mind at some point I'm excited about taking it on the road with me like that's something I'm thinking about as as I try to push myself to get on the road a little bit more I'm again I brought up 10 times I'm so in operations mode I'm literally sitting at a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] desk for 12 hours a day 80% of the time right now so it's not the most compelling but there is a wild almost like um entrepreneurial ASMR with it like it's been really interesting to watch a lot of people as a matter of fact everybody who's listening right now twitch.tv/ garve if you come in say you came from here because I want to give love to him like come and check it out what I'm noticing is for a lot of beginners or even people in the middle kind of like what daily V was when I put it out where people like oh he's busy busy M there's something that is like inspiring to a lot of people like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man is he just like a does he go to the B like you see it right that's does he go to the bathroom like why is he not taking L like and then of course the people that have been watching from the beginning the last couple weeks they're like no he's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] robot like and and what it does I think and it would by the way I understand it again 16-year-old me who one day dreams to be a great businessman I I do a lot of stuff for 15-year-old me I would have loved to come home from after school put that on if I looked up to garyb and be like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's what it takes it's not the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you like you know it's not private planes it's not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the watches oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I better get to work and then and by the way check this out that will then help them say am I up for that or should I do something like it's not that I want them to be me I want them to use me as a proxy to figure out if there's valuable for them I have no interest in people working 15 hours a day unless they're like me which is it is their favorite thing to do in the world for me it is my hobby my profession is my hobby and and if that's not you then you should only work seven hours a day when I don't do things I like I want to do them for one minute a day and if you don't like your job you shouldn't work 10 hours a day that sounds [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] miserable that's why I got D's and Fs that's why I don't like going to the gym that's why I don't hang pictures on the wall cuz I don't like handyman [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah other people can't wait for tomorrow it's a Friday as we're recording this to do work around the house they enjoy it it's their therapy it's their ASMR I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I would rather rip my arm off than [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] paint a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wall yeah everyone's different you know what's heavily underrated too it's as you're talking about you don't want to do these things it's if you're an entrepreneur designing the organization around your strengths oh that's the only way I've built all my companies the first thing I do every time I build a company is surround people with strengths in the things that I don't like to do that are most important M we hired a head of legal Mark yudkin who's now my coo it's my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] brother we hired him way too early we couldn't afford him we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I went for it I was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it we're gonna need this and I give I'm not reading a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] contract or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mind right you know so I'm with you you know yeah yeah you know um you said this on the podcast years ago uh I think someone asked you straight up how much money do you make Gary and then at the time it was like 5 million bucks or whatever like how much like and I think I'm not even going to ask you that question it's this ties in with uh the question that you had with my first million so they asked you this your pod's not live yet with them but um what are the what's the difference between billionaires versus millionaires you know look I think I think there's a lot of differences I I think the one that most stands out for me or one of the things that most stands out for me is there's a lot and it's funny I'm trying to recall what I said to those guys and I it's not popping up you want to hit no I actually don't because I think it'll be more interesting for you let alone everybody else um to me it's it's their obsession with losing you know like like what how much do they love the game right like they're how pure breed are they like I think billionaires tend to like it way over the things that come along with it they're tolerance for losing right um their self-awareness you know putting yourself in position to succeed you know and there's Serendipity there's you know do you recognize where the economics are I think there's tons of people who are millionaires that could have had the potential to be billionaires if they just picked a different genre to put their energy against a better business model yeah right I think about that a lot I know I didn't go into that with them like I I think about that a lot those things stand out makes sense yeah what you had said was um the willingness to walk backwards uh yeah to go to zero yeah that goes back to the Love of the Game I defined it more for them I think that I think I'm on that path that I think whether I get there or not is complet I could give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah um because by the time when I get there it's not gonna be as cool anymore anyway like starting to get to a place where like people are like well that's common and plus you know that so many people claim it that aren't it um I'm willing to go to zero yeah and I think and I do think that there is some uh um realities to that um I I think the risks that are required for the bets that turn out to be those things are sometimes and oftentimes grounded in a Bezos sort of Elon or an Oprah willing to take a risk that would have taken him all the way back or zero and I want the kids to hear this it doesn't mean like they were like really going to go to zero but it was like going to mean that they weren't going to make any money for five years right right right like I'm definitely in that place I'm I'm willing to go there not put myself out of business right but [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] myself up for a good seven years cuz I'm not worried about the Judgment yeah and you here's what you told them this is where the the five million ties in kind of um you only need your safety net what's the safety net million dollars in cash that sounds kind of low well listen for people that are very fortunate that have crushed it for every normal person they like that's an insane amount of money and I think my normal person DNA is so much greater than my entrepreneur that crushed at DNA that I'm just very aware that a million dollars in cash most a lot of people won't earn that cuz don't forget you got to pay taxes so like like I just feel like if I lost everything and had a million and again we're not playing some weird Fantasy game I'd still be me I would have just learned whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I did to lose it all which would have been a big learning experience right and I'd still be me I could turn a million dollars into $20 million just flipping [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on eBay that's funny what what what would you flip on eBay I mean I you know the reality is it goes back to listening yeah I would go to eBay and take a look at Trends I mean I me and my brother AJ were buying video games and vintage Rock t-shirts to flip on eBay in 1999 think about how right we ended up like and that only happened because you could see the data starting to emerge I'm not sure if marbles are popping off or scarfs or magnets or cocoa melon early Collectibles I don't know what's popping on eBay like that but I promise you if I was back to zero and I had a million no question buying and selling [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] would be the first thing I'd go to cuz for me and my skill set one to five million would come fastest as buying something and selling it for more got it I want to talk about V friends um but before we get to that I remember there was a clip of you talking to another I'll just call him an influencer I'm not I'm not even name names but this guy was asking you guys were collaborating he's like who works harder you or me who's oh Works harder yeah and I said me you yeah you said there's just no way I work harder and it's like 18 hours a day right um do you think it takes 15 to 18 hours a day or is it just more so cuz you enjoy it more so than enjoy I think there on the record so as cool as that little like peacocking Flex is like let there be no confusion there are tons of people that work eight hours a day who make more money than me and are happier than me I'm really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happy but I'm and I Bean like really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happy but I'm not delusional enough to not think that there's people who are equally if not more happy and work eight hours a day and that's awesome and by the way I envy that zero mhm uh no I don't think working harder is like some sort of cool Flex I think it was misunderstood by Society working harder when you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of it I love when everyone tried to pin me seven years ago like you're the hustle porn guy remember that article that was written and I was like this is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up this is so not taking the words out of my mouth and and you're completely taking me out of context literally my first book was crush it how to cash in on your passion yeah why'd you take the passion part out yeah because I've been on the record that I did no homework in high school I don't believe in work if you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate it I'm actually the most extreme example of all in when you love it and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if you hate it I just told you about the sign thing I don't think you should work at all if you hate it I don't know how you're going to live but like you know like like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so no I I don't thank you for asking that question because I'm it's giving me a few minutes to really break this down I think I think people continue to not hear me and others on this working a lot is only cool if it's a com if it starts with you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love it comma yes do I think if you do a 100 push-ups that that would be better for your physique than 30 I believe in that volume quantity is not debatable yeah so if I versus me my twin brother who is exactly me Barry if if I work 12 and he works seven and we were the same yes I would get more outcome it's the way it is sorry but all these people that work 10 12 hours a day to be a entrepreneur to act cool all to just make money so that they can go ball out and are living lives where they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] drinking a bottle of vodka at night to deal with their pain that's not happy that's not good that doesn't work out and so no that's that's how I I I don't think it requires hours I think it requires self-awareness right you have to know yourself some people don't even have the Natural Energy work that much right like that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard but I think the energy comes from loving it yeah right like I can't run on a treadmill for 20 minutes this is real now I really can't like Fast right but I can play four hours of basketball straight which is actually harder on my 48y old body yeah but because I love it I go and because I think running a treadmill is the worst [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of all time I can't this thing is so underrated bro this thing is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bro this thing is so underrated and the other one because now I'm rolling this thing I believe when we're dead and we're looking down in from Heaven that intuition the second brain will be much more understood no one's talking about it I can tell you right now this has made all the good decisions y this has kept it from being Delirious y but this has been everything and no one's and that's above my pay grade but I'm telling you this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing and this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing both of them right now by us humans and we're getting cool now like ice plunge [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] psychedelics grounding like we're starting to figure like we're starting to become more you know old school like everything that's hot right now amongst influencers my great grandma Babushka Ana made me do when I was six and she would visit us in Edison she'd like wake us up in the morning dew this is real talk and make us go outside and walk Barefoot I'm like what are we doing we're supposed to be Americanized this is so weird and now the coolest kids in La like are like give me the grass and I was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Babushka Ana you know like like so old school's becoming new now but I promise you the thing that no one's talking about yet for real for real that I think is going to be common talk in 50 to 100 years is this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the intuition the gut and everybody wants to we went over rational the last 100 years y you actually I mean speaking of your gut you basically bet all in on Twitter and Facebook right y That's your gut y if we can segue into be friends right now do I believe in nfts remarkably I know where nfts are right now but again at the you know you seem to be really on it this will land with you at the height of nfts I was making videos saying these things are going 99% are going to zero nfts the the mistake that most people are listening right now that don't know about nfts as a collectible digital asset is they think nfts are Beanie Babies they don't realize that nfts are stuffed animals it's a genre 99% of the projects ended up being Beanie Babies yeah but just like contemporary art with Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol just like basketball trading cards Michael Jordan's rookie cards worth a lot of money 99% aren't just like sneakers just like watches just like everything that's collectible 99% are zero 1% is remarkable the hysteria of the moment got everyone thinking every single one was going to be collectible right but yeah I'm really excited about it for me personally it's really exciting because I think of be friends as my intellectual property which it is a Pokemon meet Sesame Street so Sesame Street of like good intent I want to teach accountability through accountable ant and patience through patient Panda um and collectibility like Pokemon and like right now if you want to know what's going on with be friends go to eBay right now everyone who's listening and type in vriends enter completed auctions you will be blown away and so quietly quietly I would say I am head down building something I have a kids book coming out called meet me in the middle I have cartoons coming out with with moon bug who does coco melon and I promise you anyone who has a one to threeyear Old in their world or recently knows exactly what I'm talking about so I'm enjoying the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of building my Marvel Pokemon and and again back to patience V friend is Vayner media 2010 and 11 when everybody laughed at me and vriends in 20 years will be vriends and everyone's going to look back at clips and be like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man you really knew it two final questions before we wrap here so what's the 10-year vision for it because it was Disney before it's something else now well Disney it's still was it was it was always like Disney Sesame Street it was always IP the reason I now say Sesame Street is I don't think I fully appreciated how good Jim Henson's intent was man I admire him yeah remember watching that stuff it's really yeah it really did a nice thing all the integrating immigrants and bilingual stuff and teaching love and accountability he did a great job Fraggle Rock the brief was stop War I re my admiration for Jim Henson the last five years has exploded um and the collectibility part is very real I I know that if I don't make it pokemones or marveles that this the collectible Valley won't be there and I want vriend series 1 nfts to be one of the great collectibles in the next two three years excuse me two three decades and I'm excited about grinding that out so the vision is fully the same get 8 billion people to fall in love with large town with the very very very very lucky black cat who's the logo P you know empathy elephant main character dialed in dog Dynamic Dino perfect Persian cat if I can get people to fall in love with them then the collectibility will kick in all the opportunities will kick in and it's all built on the blockchain so many things I can do in the future as the world learns about the underlining technology the legalities around so there's a lot to still uncover but I was there in 9567 89 2000 for internet 1 I was there for 2004 5 6 7 8 for internet 2 and I'm here for this now and I'm excited about the decade out all right well Gary we could go on and on but um we'll end it here what's the best way for people to find the book online I mean people know how to buy books if you can't find day trading attention by G like I don't know does chat gbt excite you more than Google do you not know what Amazon is uh I have a funny feeling they can find it but I thank you for that all right thanks so much thank you [Music] no
