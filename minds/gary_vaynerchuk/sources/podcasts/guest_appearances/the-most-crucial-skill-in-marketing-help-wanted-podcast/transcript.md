# The Most Crucial Skill In Marketing — Help Wanted Podcast

the number one most important thing in all of communication not just marketing as we sit here today is your organic social media creative strategy that all of marketing and everything starts before you spend money on media amplification it is how you extract consumer insights it is the most important thing to raise money for your business to raise money for the PTA to be elected local mayor to sell flowers of your flower shop locally if you want something to happen the number one most important thing in the world now is your organic social media content strategy and capability attention is the number one asset Gary yes I'm really excited you wrote this book because number one so much great Insight in it but also I'd say as Nicole and I talk to business owners to creators the number one thing people want is how do we get attention Y how do I get people to pay attention to the things that I'm building how do I grow which is really how to get attention yeah if you don't if you don't have attention you can't start the process of growing and you write in the book the number one skill people need in marketing is to understand attention understand where it comes from understand how to find it in undervalued areas I want to dig into that phrase understanding attention what do you think people misunderstand about attention actualized attention versus potential attention the practicality of it I I live a lot of my life right now in Madison Avenue land Fortune 500 companies spend most of their money on potential reach versus actualized reach and what does that mean that means that literally $70 billion in television media spent a year and 90% of it goes into garbage uh banner ads programmatic digital you mean garbage because nobody's seeing it that's right yeah you know this is something that really bothers a lot of people in my business but I just don't understand how one's even willing to debate this oh but Gary people watch sports I'm like I know I'm one of them but I don't watch I watch the entire Nick Sixers game this weekend every time it went to commercial break high-fiving with my brother texting my Nick's thread and sending something on Twitter to out from the ads no PR I if you gave me it all to recall one I got no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shot so I've spent a lot of money on print I love print I write books I like magazines a lot still to touch it yeah but like you're paying on circulation actually that's not even true when you buy a full page ad in a newspaper or magazine you're paying based on if that magazine or newspaper was left on a bus and saw by another person they multiply yeah they multiply it's a ridiculous number it's like fugazi yeah but all of marketing numbers are besides can you see the sales Can You Feel the and then the brand is the game this is where people get away with it they're right brand over sales right like you when you do a Super Bowl ad you'll you'll potentially feel something in the short term but it advertises over time branding marketing for sure you can't fully measure it especially if it's how you feel versus how you transact in the short term but look I I I think that influencers they are really bad at platform distribution they they blow up on Instagram and they just want to stay there four years ago I know both of you know this five years ago I'm screaming through my content t Tock Tik Tock Tik Tok and the number one reason that people that were winning on Instagram didn't go was insecurity or laziness because they were afraid to rebuild on Tik Tok they to start at zero my brother I'm so I love how you quickly I feel like you really went there with me they did not want to deploy the humility needed to start over right they couldn't deal with like being at 40,000 followers when they had 800,000 and you know it's worth noting that that's not just a problem with people building social followings that's literally everybody in any kind of business or any kind of career you have success in one area and as the market as the ground underne you want take you want to take it a higher level up yeah yeah there are people literally right now who are deeply unhappy in their relationship and they're not willing to get divorced because they feel that that will be viewed as a failure yeah they're willing to live the rest of their lives un happy because of the ideology of what it would look like to take a step backwards right you know which is less noble than doing it because you want the kids to have like like I don't know like it's just it's the human journey of like lack of humility anyway I believe that the reason I've done well with day trading attention for my entire career is I'm not scared of restarting I'm not scared of being wrong I'm not scared of changing my mind I'm not scared is really the theme and and then can I can I imagine a Critic of what you said so you can answer yes you're also not afraid because anywhere you go you can draw attention if you start on madone tomorrow you're probably already on Master if you were to start tomorrow you could get people to pay attention to you hard for 27 people watching me on in my office on Twitch live streaming 27 cuz I'm mute I'm not doing anything compelling like I don't have attention there I haven't pushed the hardest yet because I also know that I'm not able to have compelling content there but couple things number one that goes back to my Instagram Tik Tok thing all those Instagram models comedians you know thought leaders they too could have sent over their following there MH number two following to next platform is earned I can because I earned it by bringing value to my audience however it wasn't always like that for me mhm right so like you know like I I think that and the reason I brought that up is just just to to be thinking about the person who is starting from zero right now also they're scared to do dances back then it was only like shaking your ass but it wasn't like I was on musically and it wasn't but to your point and to your credit 60% was if you were a practitioner and you looked at it every day and you could see other things were emerging and then back to the point of like skills like you have to be good at it and you have to provide value but you know I think look the concept of attention is the most fascinating thing to me because I don't think you can get elected for office I don't think that you I mean all every November it's going to happen again this November forget about the presidential election every November there's an upset out of Ohio there's a shock in New Mexico and like I sit around with like my inner circle I'm like no it's not that person made 8,000 times more social content than the incumbent who ran all their money on television you know and they're like oh but Gary young people don't vote young people aren't the only ones consuming content on social networks your grand is going ham on Facebook she sure is you know what I mean oh yeah my dad's on Facebook all the time you know what I mean like and by the way not just on Facebook like the amount of 40 50 and 60 year olds consuming real levels of content on Tik Tok is real MH it's real and so you know I think the biggest thing I could say is and I'm kind of leaning into the you know both of you asked me before we went on a little bit about like how's the book going what's going on or what was the most surprising thing you know I actually have an answer to what I've most observed in the last month I myself am now comfortable putting this flag in the ground and I'm not willing to hedge anymore the number one the number one most important thing in all of communication not just marketing as we sit here today is your organic social media creative strategy that all of marketing and everything starts before you spend money on media amplification before it is how you extract consumer insights it is the most important thing to raise money for your business to raise money for the PTA to be elected local mayor to sell flowers of your flower shop locally or if you're BMW or YSL or Louis Baton like it it the Coca-Cola like selfish selfless capitalistic altruistic if you want something to happen mhm the world now is your organic social media content strategy and capability and that's why I went Ham on this book that's why I went further than I've ever taken myself with this book this book is borderline boring to me it's so detailed it's like a texy textbook it looks like a textbook well you got you guys are better students than I am so let me double click on that point that you just made and a phrase that you used which was which was extracting consumer insights so what that reminded me of was Gary I don't know if you remember this but you and I got a drink God knows how many years ago and I had asked you a question which was how do you keep track of which ideas of yours make good content and what you did was you pulled out your phone you opened Twitter and you said here's my strategy I don't know if it still is but this is what I said at the time and I've repeated this to so many people cuz was so smart he you said this is what this is what you do anytime you have an idea you test it out on Twitter just throw it out there it's basically a record of how much people respond to this idea and if it's good even in a short one or two sentence form it's worth developing further maybe then you take it somewhere else maybe you talk about it a little bit more and you use a little bit of a Proving Ground as the starting point for understanding for extracting consumer insights for seeing what people will respond to and then once you know that you can go larger with not only is it my strategy it has now elevated to what we're talking about it is now so refined if that was 101 back then or 2011 I would say when we sat down well I'm in the 401 course of this now the I don't make content and I make a lot of it and my clients make even more of it without even thinking about that being a premise like that's in the batter yeah like it's in the meal it's an ingredient it's a salt and pepper and olive oil you're cooking in it's like I would never think and I know that most people don't think this way and I would never think about making content without also being curious to the Quant and qual data that comes out of that individual post doesn't even cross my mind to post anything on Earth that isn't at some level also or significantly trying to understand everything a test all of my talking is actual listening tell me what does that mean it's a good line it's funny cuz I'm so hyper and I'm so high energy and I talk a lot and I jump in and I interrupt and I kind of like went through like a really interesting two or three year period with myself because I'm like G it's like you know I'm like what not like GH it's bad I'm like it felt like there was deeper reason I was doing that and like the reality is is that besides the time everyone sees me in these formats I'm in the listening business I'm normally in my back cave you know and just doing my homework and so I'm incredibly curious I'm deeply empathetic and I don't understand why anyone would do anything unless it was good for them and I believe that most people when they're communicating or doing something are thinking about what's in it for them you know even again I'm going back to this book I really feel accomplished in happy about it I don't know if I've I've always written books for the audience that's why my books do well M I don't but this one I pushed myself into uncomfortable territory there's like charts and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in this yeah there are there are charts and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guys I'm a dnf student for real like this was like if you watch the footage of me in the in the booth doing the audio recording of the the audio book it was a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] three-day grind I felt it I watched some of it yeah right like listen to I literally rather be like in the like climbing the Himalayas in a t-shirt like it was like incredibly challenging but I think I think I often talk not for reaction but it's it I'm asking questions I'm curious I'm trying I'm trying to provide value I'm also efficient so like I'm trying to provide value and extract the next Insight or the next curiosity or I love getting people to ponder different perspectives which will get them to verbalize things it I'm looking for the unlock at all times what you're describing is the interpersonal version of the thing that you just told me you do on Twitter that's right which is to say and and I I found that to be very useful for myself too which is when you're talking what you're also doing is you're developing new ideas and you're seeing how they take and if they take well then you can develop them further and if they don't then you can move on it feels like in a way you've taken the strategy that works really well online and just applied it to testing ideas all the time the reverse yeah the reverse the reverse the way I lived my life before I hit online at 34 years old was what I brought to online what is very clear to me is that I got very fortunate in the way I grew up different I grew up in very diverse neighborhoods I grew up very humble and very very attracted to spending time with like Elder I was a very like in hindsight I'm like oh this all makes sense but I was the kid that would roll up on grandparents when they were at the park and talk to them about like JFK's assassination and the man on the I was curious about modern history and people I was like where did you grow I mean when you're 11 and your friend's grandparents come to the neighborhood and you're playing basketball outside and you're drawn to going to sit to them and say like where are you from gertude how did you grow up where were you when JFK got assassinated why did Ronald Reagan win so easily where's the beef did you buy Wendy's but who do you have siblings like when you're that you're like the little kid from Jerry Maguire yeah you know what that's a really like you know I'd like to think I was a little cuter but you know like I'm just kidding he's pretty damn cute uh yes I was absolutely like that but what if somebody wasn't like that what if they were 11-year-old sitting in the corner reading and an introvert and now they're hearing come out and be on social media go get the attention Mak sense a couple things love that first of all no business needs to have a person in the front of it really business needs to have a person in the front of it it's lovely it's really good I'm a big fan humans like humans but there are many small businesses many midsize businesses and many large businesses that don't have a human face that's right accounts or they create mascots I don't know Johnny Geico I know the Geico lizard right like so if someone like me who really analyzes there's a lot of hot dog stands flower shops carwashes that are just good at Tik Tok Trends or just very good at audio storytelling a lot of people actually like being behind the camera but in front of the camera meaning you hear their voice but you never really see them there's a lot of ways to go about it plus even as a personal brand I think you to know this about me I feel like um our relationships will this should land you also in control of how public you are I am remarkably out there but I have been historically incredibly private about my personal life right so every like you have a lot more control so a couple things to the introverts number one you don't need to be having your face all over the place number two I think for people that aren't intuitively curious or aren't intuitively creative let's just talk it through they have to recognize like tough [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is how business works and here's what I mean by that it doesn't mean that they still can't be be successful but they have to find answers I naturally hate working out or eating healthy same spent my whole life into my late 30s not having a muscle in my body and just not doing the right things I had to decide if I was going to really bunker down and go through the mental you know process of getting myself into a position to fix it and I did and so like I the way I think about small businesses not doing the things that I think are principled for Success I'm very empathetic to it every day including this morning was such a grind for me to get into the gym I hate it you two like you can't imagine I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate it what do you tell yourself how do you do it I that I just prefer to live longer and be healthier and be happier like I just it's just something the world has gotten incredibly incredibly bad at being comfortable being uncomfortable yeah I mean so it's the bne brown like you don't have to be live tweeting your bikini wax to be vulnerable or live Tik tocking your colonoscopy like when you think about vulnerability you might think that you have to expose all of these things and I struggle with this too because I don't want to talk about my personal life I never do I'm like let's just talk about it's never even crossed my mind to talk about me going to the dentist or having a colon like to me my private life is my private life like vulnerability can come in very different shapes and sizes keep going no I think that I think that for me I struggle with trying to show other parts that I'm just not comfortable with and and I look at you and you really do inspire me to say like I don't have to show family stuff like I just don't and you have that much attention to day trade and and and night trade and long-term investing and all of it uh that I think it's it's really admirable that you don't have to go to those places that people think if you're are vulnerable yeah I think if you're not happy the action will not be sustainable like everybody who's listening right now who's like like grinning their teeth every time they post like it's not going to work out you're not going to be able to sustain it another thing that both of you know is I've really been doing it a long time like I'm a marathon runner I've been like uncomfortably consistent since 2006 and you know Nicole you and I really met early like all like if you think about all the plethora of personalities that popped out in that 2005 6 78 era there are not a lot of you can count them on your hand of people that have kind of stayed the course and I believe it's because my framework was sustainable for me cockroach cockroach you know there's in V friends my little you know Sesame Street uh Pokemon uh I intellectual property company I created 283 characters and um the cockroach is conviction cockroach and I do think conviction conviction that is not delusional is what keeps you alive forever and I've had very strong conviction about this which was one I'm only going to share what I want to share two and this is a big one I want everyone to hear this I'm going to share stuff that's good for them not good for me and here's what I mean by that you know when like somebody takes a photo of them like on a private plane I'd like to understand what how that's good for the audience because what I've thought then and now I'm fully in belief of 10 years later is that was going to only just lead to people's own insecurities flaring up on them yeah like everyone's living their best life ever because people don't think about what's bringing value to the audience well I think for sure if if you're really flying on a jet you're not taking pictures most they're not sitting on real private planes there are you know right there are there are private planes that people rent just to sit in and take photos even better in Russia there was a startup that just built a studio that was a private BL people rolling through it's really scary but look surface look Lifestyles people are like oh my God these kids the reason they have so much anxiety is everyone's showing all this stuff on on social media I'm like do you know what MTV Cribs was do you know what Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous were in the 80s like we didn't have alternatives to consume stuff so anyway look I think I think long- winded um a lot of this starts with perspective and mental Frameworks and I think before people even get into the tactics of day trading attention they have to decide like who they are what makes them happy where they go but they do have to understand those things it does not make me happy to eat well and go in the gym it does not come natural MH but I know it's important and in the business framework you may think social media is stupid it may not come natural to you but it is eating up attention at such a rapid pace and basically for the ogs that are listening there used to be the television there still is and there used to be ABC NBC CBS PBS there was like 13 channels even when I was a little little kid that's how it rolled before cable and that's how I see the phone the phone is now the television and YouTube and Facebook and Instagram and Tik Tok and Snapchat they're the ABC NBC and CBS and we as humans can do two things we could be the mash and the Seinfeld or we can be the Coca-Cola and Proctor and G we can both produce the creative that is consumed and we can also run the ads and that is the framework do you think Tik tok's going to get banned I do what do you think is going to happen I think that I'm going to have to really like be on my sharpest game for 30 days to understand where all that ungodly attention is going because that's what I do for a living I want to be the best state Traer of attention in the world and I feel like I'm like already me you know when you have to like a boxer like train for months before a fight I'm not joking the reason I answer like so clearly like I do is not because I have any like real political feelings about it I don't even want to get into the emotion of debating this there's so much to it I'm just taking it to the business level of like okay this is probably going to happen and that is a SC it's unprecedented in the history of American pop culture for that much attention to disappear in one shot and have to find a home it's like water you know like the damn break it has to find a home and you know I as we sit here today I'm like okay there's got to be at least two dozen really smart kids building their own apps trying to capture it so you don't think an entrepreneur or a group of a Syndicate can come in and buy it oh I don't think they're going to sell it I don't think that's how the geopolitical war is playing out I think it's very cute and and ideological I I could be very wrong about this and this is so above my pay grain that I can't wait to look back at this and be like you were wrong but if I'm a betting man I don't see China selling it so easily it's too valuable for it to have the discourse that it had in India but isn't that scary though to businesses who not only lose attention overnight but then lose customers because they don't own those customers yeah but that's how the world's always worked in advertising like you don't own your customers when you buy a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal you know like when you're an Advertiser you're renting at all times and as a Creator these are you know I always tell everybody they're free like what do you like I'm so mad at Facebook the algorithm's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me it's free thank you but it's like lower on the funnel than you know a newspaper ad or something people were looking at it closer to conversion where it could really hurt sales or reue it's going to hurt sales you know what else hurt sales iOS 145 update true story and podcast downloads right like you know what I was hurt business well do you know why everybody has AAA cleaners and trip a like insect repeller company and AAA carpet cleaners because if your company was called AAA you show up first in the Yellow Pages so you know what really hurt business search engines they destroyed the Yellow Pages and people walked around with their companies named AAA [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] carpet cleaners which now while you drive down the street and you see restaurants called great Chinese restaurant that's right because it's what shows up in search gole correct yeah so look attention and the plat forms that own attention will constantly change you know what really hurt ABC NBC and CBS cable television you know what hurt cable television the internet you know like it's it's a forever game and and that's really the big issue at hand right now we are in an extreme game of halves and Have Nots that know how to day trade attention right now and the advantage is to small the advantage right now is to the individual humans and entrepreneurs because big corporate companies are so so stuck in 1980s 2000s 2010 marketing and they're buying programmatic banners they're buying Billboards they're buying radio they're buying television it's you you'd be shocked and then they're obsessed with tomorrow I have more five Fortune 500 clients three years ago willing to spend a million dollars in building a store in the metaverse that had eight people in it than they are in spending money on social media creative because advertising in big companies are romantic about yesterday let's just make one more good TV spot it's still there they're infatuated with tomorrow if we don't spend a billion on AI we're going to be dead and they suck at today and today social media creative organic across these 10 platforms is the starting point to insights to Performance ads the algorithms are so good that when your organic creative does well that's when you slightly tweak it and turn it into a performance ad that's the post iOS 145 game yeah you do it well you see what works and then you throw money at it but you don't think of it as test and learn you don't think of it as throw against the wall and see what sticks you don't think of it as spray and prey I don't tweet complete random [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's all thoughts so I think of it as advertising for the sake of better advertising when people hear it sometimes they think it's one of those three things oh this is test and Learn by calling it test and learn it devalues the individual social media post to me an individual social media post is more important than a print ad from 10 years ago it has the potential to reach millions of people Gary what do you think about LinkedIn right now I mean is is is it a place where there's wide open space to to grow in a way that like is harder on inst getting a job tool I think indeed and Linkedin are good utilities yeah as a social network I think LinkedIn is a wide openen space I mean I've and both of you know this cuz I know we like are around each other enough again this is another one that I've been yelling about for four to five years MH it's been wide open in supply and demand issues Jason's listened to I have not yes yet Yes sounds about right yeah I've invested heavily in my time on link appreciate you're noticing and keep put it gun to my head I could not tell you my life scary super scary is you would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slay on there thanks you would Crush thank you because because one of the things that you've always had is Merit of your thoughts and idea like LinkedIn is a place that deeply rewards deeper thought it just does you have the chops for that thank you you know what's also really interesting about LinkedIn I agree with I don't like going to the gym I don't like doing LinkedIn but you know what you never regret a workout maybe you never regret a LinkedIn post I think that's I really think it's true and Linkedin is now probably the final platform that's going all in on the tiktock ification of social media meaning the four you page meaning anybody who's listening right now I've I've spent a career actually let's talk about this I've spent 15 years going as hard as anyone in amassing followers across all these platforms I've now been commoditized Nicole's first post on LinkedIn even though I have five six million followers on LinkedIn can reach more people than my last 80 posts the Merit of the individual post now creates the reach not how many followers you have right that's profound flattened it's profound it's probably the most exciting thing for everybody who's listening you think you're behind right if I've been building a house for 15 years and you're starting today I should be ahead that's not what's happened social media took a huge tweak it's now interest graph not social graph it's the interest Network now it's not the social network it's the individual piece of content have you sponsored any of your posts how like run ads yeah of course and how much money are you making that way nothing I'm not selling anything um but like like it's I'm not converting into anything but I do it occasionally just to see like like I'm always trying to be a practitioner um but wi text you know I four or five years ago I three years ago I launched winetext.com from my dad it's a texting it's Groupon for wine comes in text right we talked about it when we were together right that is running real like it's I don't think of it is sponsored the way I think everyone thinks about it I think about it as an individual piece of content has done well who should I amplify who should I run ads against for this for what I as Gary ve am in brandland at all times it's all brand I'm not looking for the sale when I come out with a V for zft when I come out with a empathy wines when I come out with the book I'll ask for the sales and I'm thrilled to amplify and promote those as well but it's so every 3 four years I'm thinking more as brand if I have a piece of content that I think is resonating with an audience I want more people to see it right and so I think of it as like running a commercial for the sake of brand well I think people who are listening want to understand like how you monetize how they can monetize what's realistic or if you should look at social media not as a monetization no no you look first of all the ultimate way to monetize is Bill brand not sales so to me you know that's that's first and foremost you know so I think that people should understand that after they have success with Organic social amplifying that to be a sales or a brand play is absolutely right let me give you a quick for instance you're a local flower shop I'll just use it and you put out a really nice like you you did a time lapse of you putting together a bouquet makes sense good music and it hits you normally get 8 00 views on your Tik Tok or Instagram and this one gets 48,000 but you're a flower shop that only sells locally in De Moine and you got 48,000 views it could be all over the place but now you take that same video you bring it back to your Adobe or whatever you know what however you're editing and now you add your phone number like free shipping on this bouquet now you change the copy now you may end with you doing another thing saying like literally you run it that same video and at the end you add more video to it saying hey this was a post I did a couple of weeks ago that everybody went crazy for I'm actually selling this bouquet it's $49.99 you know click the link below or email me lincol bio and then you run it for $80 against 40 to 50y Old females in De Moine got it got it got it yeah because what you're doing here is you're utilizing the power of these platforms to get affirmation that the creative matters mitigating the creative risk which has always been the waste of marketing this guy just wrote a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] textbook yeah yeah you know though like like it's really cool because I know you're following like no like Super Bowl is the best ad in marketing 8 million bucks you cannot get 130 million people to watch a 30 second video if you're the best day trader on All Digital social yeah the problem is if the video is not good if the 30 second commercial is not good you wasted at all well you talked about in the book The Ocean Spray dude but like everybody's looking for the Ocean Spray dude lightning in a bottle but it's happening more than you think what I didn't talk about was the mango gummy from Walgreens from their private label nice for everybody's listening right now I really want you to do what I'm saying as you're walking the dog working out I want you to hear this go to eBay right now and search nice mango gummy okay I'm being dead serious right now you will see on eBay right now that it's selling for 10 5 n 12 bucks a bag it's a dollar whatever yeah one Tik Tock made by a normal person sold out the product nationally Ocean Spray nice I can give you 40 more examples there's not a one TV commercial in the last decade that sold out anything nationally around the country it's over like it's over and everyone's holding on for dear life and that is actually the opportunity for normal people cuz as long as Coca-Cola continues to take hundreds of millions of dollars and throw it directly in the garbage that leaves attention available for Rick and Johnny and Sally and Susan and Nicole and Jason and Nicole and Jason just want our gummies all right Gary we're gonna end with this please Gary vaynerchuk master of social media we want to play a game with you yes sir it's called go or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop and I was going to say bullish or be but he wanted to make it I want very Gary go or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop what I'm going to do is we're going to Rapid Fire off things that are happening on social media tell us go keep going do it good idea [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop it's over okay number one CEOs firing people are doing something hard filming themselves crying posting it to LinkedIn got it so a CEO trying to get empathy from the audience but by doing something that we all know is like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you dude or lady yeah like uh uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop so corporate apologies on Instagram you're not you're not tricking anybody I'll give you a different one how about going completely the other side of the pillow I'm sorry but business unlike government unlike schools unlike parenting unlike the media has actual pnls bank Covenant and is the closest thing to sports and is based on Merit so I had to fire these people because I want to hit a certain profit margin I think I think the reason it's not Landing is everyone knows they're full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and meanwhile the easiest way for them to not be full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is these people get other jobs I'm making a business decision mhm okay go or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop Executives dancing on social media well if it's like like that famous Microsoft dance with with balar and all those guys I would say keep going because that's all time great um I'm going to say go dancing is always the right decision even if you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] suck at it yes uh go or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop AI chat Bots go if you have not started understanding that AI is oxygen it is the internet it is one of the most profound techn you've got to start getting used to it because it's going to eat up most of the rest of your life go or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop influencer tours of your facility like Sheen the sheen thing that's that's you know Oh you mean like that bad one like like I'm going to say a weird thing I'm going to say go you should [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop having like bad facilities but giving tours is storytelling and I think there's plenty of great businesses doing the right thing and little nuances of like a funny picture in the background or like not if you're the same place that has a foosball table and all the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but like if you've got something unique or clever it will capture a lot of people's attention go or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop long ass threads on Twitter go I think that as far as the long threads I was here's why I said go I want everyone to hear this is a good point people will watch eight hour movies I always believe this and I finally won the debates with my friends because people binge watch all of Wednesday Adams on Netflix in an afternoon that's an 8 Hour movie MH it's all it is it's an8 hour movie and people will stop watching an 11c video 2 seconds in cuz you suck at it and it's garbage length has always been a confusing thing in the last decade or two for people on quality the reason I say go is some of the best stuff I've ever consumed was a 40 tweet rant from someone who really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] knows something about something and were able to articulate it in written form and then obviously a lot of people stink at it but if you're good at it the medium is really good so actually related go or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop 10- minute long Tik Tok videos people don't know this you can post 10 minutes on there I go go go by the way I would argue go go go on anything long form social media I believe the social networks X for sure meta I believe snap I don't think is thinking this way if I'm guessing but they will soon my prediction is that one of the major social networks will become one of the most important streaming services in the next decade the attention's there why wouldn't they I always thought that Twitter should have been a streaming service because it is the water cooler of us cons in long form video when we watch sports and movies we go to or or live TV we go to Twitter to talk about it if they integrated that I think X should be a streaming service right go or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop giveway campaigns to drive follower growth oh I think that's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop and I'll tell you why let me I'll it's a tricky one perception is reality so I get why people want more followers because it makes them feel like the brand is stronger the reason I'm go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the reason I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop on it is the the kind of user you get that came for like a free Tesla isn't staying for you anyway so there's the lifetime value of that user is very low last one go or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop podcasters playing a game with Gary on podcasts because they think it'll make good content keep [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going I'm talking about [Music]
