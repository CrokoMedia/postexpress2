# What Social Media Platforms To Focus On In 2024 — Marketing Against The Grain

there isn't a day that goes by that I don't get 13 questions of so what are you going to do Gary when Tik tok's gone and I'm like grow and they're like what I'm like what do you think's going to happen if Tik tok's banned in America all that attention has to go somewhere I believe that X is going to relaunch Vine I believe there's 4 to 50 good entrepreneurs right now building a Tik Tok competitor because they're like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it the stakes are so high if it gets banned I'm going to crush I think getting better I believe will be a winner I believe themselves will be winners but what I know is the ultimate winner will be attention is the number one asset back in the earliest earliest days probably episode 20 episode 30 very early wine libraries I think I saw it on I think I was doing web analytics on crazy egg and there was some type of like cross promotion blog article or interview or something you had done at promoting Wine Library TV and I learned a bunch about wine from you but I learned a lot about marketing from you and you have done so much over the years that one of the the places I want to start is like you've written all these books you've created all this content like what is if if you look back on it what is the most impactful piece of content you've ever made like what is that thing where you're like you know what I got the most leverage and mileage out of that more than anything else it was probably you know it's a crazy story there was a Web 2.0 conference here at the jabbit center which I'm very close to right this second and it was early I might have done three or four talks at that point in my career but I'd already been in the game and enough to like be one of the headliners and um cuz I it was pretty quick for me like I did a talk at in Miami at future of web apps FAA and that hit and then like one more talk hit and then like you know this since you found me that early there wasn't that many of us in Web 2.0 back then and so there were no creators hardly at all none and like the personalities were mainly bloggers that crossed over to video right or social like Robert Robert SK scoel and guy kowaki and Kevin Rose and dig Nati and Tim ferrah like there just wasn't that many human beings um no we're talking pre four-hour work week that like this is early early in the the cycle of all this stuff right that's right and so I gave a talk at web sum at Web 2.0 conference and it was the one where I said if you love Smurf Smurf it up and it was I just kind of exploded and just said it was my thesis for crush it which was the book that kind of put me on the map in the business World from the wine world and and what was really funny was two really Iconic web people were in The Green Room right before I went on Fred Wilson the most successful New York VC and Jason freed the founder of 37 signals who was like a real real player personality at the time uh and is one of my favorite people I met in web 2 and I said to them right before I took the stage like they're like Gary two minutes come and get miked up and I looked at both of them and I really go with my intuition and chemicals and I look at both of them and say huh either this is going to be the best talk of my career or it's all over and I'll never be speaking again and I went out there I really felt like crazy like overhyped and I'm a pretty hype dude uh and I went I blacked out and did my thing by the time I got to the wine store cuz I still was doing the wine business yeah and and we didn't have cell phone email back then by the time I got back to the wine store and checked my email I had like four book offers from people that were like I'm in the crowd I'm from Pegman putam or Simon and Schuster and then Ted picked up that video and put it on the Ted Talk website and that was it and that was really the first you know time broadly I was discovered for business talk prior to that I had done an episode of Wine Library TV where I tasted wine with with all these weird vegetables and fruits and cereal and candy that made the front page of dig and slash Dot and um meta filter all those you know places where you could be discovered back then and then that led to me being on the Conan O'Brien show and the degenerous show doing the same skit so that was my first broad thing but this was my first if you ask me impactful like the Gary career that I have today that piece of content definitely set it off I got I got I got kind of a two-part followup on that one of the things that you did amazingly well is you went from this like you were were doing content around wine you had a family business wine and you expand it into business most people have a hard time going from one thing that they do well and kind of expanding it I want to know how the hell did you do that you know I think there are a lot of people here who like feel like they're stuck in where they're at well it was weird because I was getting like I'm very proud of my wine knowledge and it's pretty significant um very significant but the reality was that kid that you saw right when you were a real kid uh back in episode 20 of wi Library TV that was February so that was March or April of 20 of 2006 yes that was now eight full years into me running the family business and 10 full years since I launched wine library.com which transformed our family business and 1990 16 years since I worked pretty much every day every weekend every summer vacation and then Monday through Friday when I was in school I was reading the wine spectator and talking to my dad at night about the business 16 years into my wine retail career and 2006 call it 1986 20 years into my true hardcore entrepreneurial career cuz in ' 86 you know I already started selling baseball cards and making hundreds you know I was really in it like not in the way that I think people understand like I was a bad student for a reason I was basically running a business since I was in sixth grade like it's all I thought about it's all I cared about I'd go to school to sell cards I'd come home and study cards and then that switch to wine and so what was ironic was I I actually wasn't adding another thing I just started communicating about the core thing I knew more than anything I know much more about operations and Entrepreneurship and marketing than I do about wine it's just that I came out the gate making a show about wine and really it's how the internet knew me for the first 5 years that I was out there all right one last question on this before we move on so really that big talk that you said was the thing that really propelled you that was like 25 plus years in the making of a culmination of a lot of experience but like how do you prepare and put something like that together I think a lot of people see you and they're like oh he's just off the cuff he just has all these ideas on the spot I don't think that's necessarily true but you know Kip I got a weird one for you brother yeah it's it's it's it's a complicated answer um I don't prep for anything not even not even for like Wine Library business meeting excuse me Vayner media business meetings I am so deeply in my craft that it's that it's just incredibly easy for me to talk like if I had to go give a talk on healthc care I'd have to prep for a 100 hours if I had to go talk but if I have to go give a keynote about the New York Knicks right now I'm good if I have to go give a keynote about wine I'm good if I have Jets forget it I could give a 400 hour keynote about um and so when I go and talk or do an interview like this with you and Kieran right now like I'm talking about what I really deeply know one of the things actually I'm glad you brought this up one of the things that I think propelled me in public speaking pretty quickly after that moment was I started going to conferences all the time and it was the same people in the circuit the same hundred people had all the Keynotes right and the same 25 really at the time May rest in peace Tony Shay founder of biz Stone one of the co-founders he was circuit hard um you know Tim Ferris who's amazing um but even like Dave Moren from Facebook and it was just the same characters right Robert scoble guy kaaki you know and one and and I mentioned those people CU these people weren't doing it but most of the people including some of the people I just mentioned they had the same presentation every time yeah the same one I would see them at the affiliate Summit affiliate marketing is quite different than Twitter marketing I'd see them at the search Summit like Google search is very different than winning on Twitter the you know and I would see them at these different things I'd see them at lay web what was going on in Paris in Europe was very different than what was going on in the US and it took me back took me a back saying huh they know this stuff but as a presenter they're just kind of like this is it slide three same joke same same kitten from the internet on slide six and I think what made me stand out was I was incredibly contextual like if I was going to France I was going to talk about what was going on on Web 2.0 in France um when I do the HubSpot podcast like I'm doing right now I'm thinking a lot about the agencies the individuals that are running within this ecosystem that may be different than if I go speak at a block chain Summit in Finland might be different than if I go talk about intellectual property at IP conferences so um I think context matters but to give everybody an answer yes I am shooting off the hip comma to answer you only cuz I'm prepped to the max CU it's my entire life right that's the important part is that like it's it's not being unprepared you prepared your entire life to talk about and here I'm a practitioner every day like literally we talk about this all the time if you're in the craft it's so much easier to talk about it I'm going to show you I I I I assume this is audio predominantly but like literally while like 9 902 literally as oh literally as we were getting ready it's kind of blurry but that green box you don't have to zoom in it's fine actually zoom in I don't it's kind of might be interesting for people like this is me writing the copy to my Instagram post right before we started you're like I'm doing the work in the moment I am literally the copywriter for my content still at this point you know what people think they think it's all like oh he's got a team I'm like no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for 11 years I did it by myself and then yes I got to a place where I have a huge team for my content but I'm still writing the copy it's still your voice no no it's my voice cuz it's me that's what I'm saying but you're saying it I'm saying it works because it is still you you not farming this out you were like I got this razor sharp perspective and I got to make sure it gets out there but I'm also like analyzing the numbers and like thinking through the first second and like like it's why I wrote the new book like I feel like I'm at the sharpest I've ever been and I I know because I've grown up in this game the last 15 years as people hit financial success as they go into different chapters of their life which is super appropriate by the way everyone gets to live their life the way they want most people have you know Del at or or Walked Away From The Trenches from the dirt from the practitioners ship I've doubled down on it I I would love to to kind of dig into this point so you you could G you could do literally anything you want to do with your life right you your latest book is on date trade and attention you basically taught a whole generation how to do that in the web to to the too the web two era one of the things that we find with marketers and I know you manage marketers or spend a bunch of time with marketers is today marketers want to graduate to strategy really quickly right like oh like I've done a Year's work now I'm a strategist and like someone else would do the actual craft but I'll direct them to do the craft what do you talk what do you say to people like that because you're deep in the craft all this time uh you know today like each and every day you're in the craft like what do you what do you say to people like that that's a great question brother um look I'm obsessed with strategy right so first I make sense like I couldn't comprehend um not over thinking about this stuff you know like think you know it's my favorite part um but I I would say to people the second you take your hand off the wheel you become a worst driver right and so I do believe that uh let's go very high up the sole reason Fortune 500 CMOS really struggle with today's marketing is they are so removed to your point so removed they don't even have have some of these apps on their phone let alone consume the creative that works on it let alone make the creative that works on it think about that they are so uncomfortably removed and so for me the reason I like being in the craft it gives me a currency a pulse of its actual success with the end consumer but this is also challenging here's why first of all if you're in the fortune 5,000 so let's include private Equity based owned businesses and and series D VCB startups sure you know if you're at that level a lot of your marketing isn't even in the trenches Fortune 500 continues to overspend on television continues to overspend on traditional thing I mean it is flabbergasting how much Fortune 500 companies spend on print magazines and newspapers there are many companies in fashion and other areas that spend more on print than they do on social creative do you know what saying that is so first of all if you're Fortune 5000 you're running on reports not on truth right internal mmm M justifying media spend that are fake creative is being done by creative agencies that want to make television ads on a good day and on a bad day want to make banner ads for the web so it it's a m ery there as you go underneath that you have a lot of Founders that start companies doing all the social creative doing all the copyrighting doing the website doing the email and it's great and then they get bougie especially the under 40-year-old set I get it they want to get to the Lambos and the private planes and the vacations and the pretty girls and the pretty boys and all the things that they want and you know they start to delegate and they they they have they have fast dreams that also leads to Quick vulnerabilities and so you know I think um I think you're right my man I'm pumped to see the way you jumped in and asked with passion cuz I do think it's the biggest it's the biggest variable out there and and I think in a world where money got expensive right like meaning raising capital is expensive now and in a world of post iOS 145 and let's call it what it was the ones that figured out that Facebook when I was yelling and screaming it was true Facebook was so effective that if you just did a very simple CAC LTV row as cookie people and travel around the whole internet and sell to them and till they finally give up that and raise tons of capital you were able to make it look like on paper you had a great business and so um that era is also over and I I think this is also one of the reasons I wrote the new book I think we're going into an era where you're going to have to be better to win um and uh and that excites me and I wanted to prepare my community or the people that have followed me or the people that are curious after to hear about it uh and I think I did just that with this new one well yeah so I want to talk I want to get into the book Daya day trading attention first of all we're catching you on a good day Brunson just hung 41 points on the 76ers the Knicks are up 31 oh 47 did he was it 47 I think so 47 jeez I forgot that and so we're catching you in a good mood most marketers the Jets had a good draft this weekend that I was thrilled with subjectively we'll see how it plays out it is a sunny Monday day in New York and I'm on with you boys I mean this is this is good stuff so we're catching you at a high at a high point most marketers right now I talk to Gary are the exact opposite they're pretty freaked out right now yes they're like oh my ads are getting more expensive my traffic to my like howto blog post it's going down yes nobody cares about my social media they're like my emails are getting open less and guess what and if they're re and if they're really smart like really smart uhoh all my traffic comes from Google and AI things like chat GPT like what if search goes away well that's what that's what we want to talk to you about like this is Kieran IED thing is like Hey we're moving into an era of day trading attention where you need personality Le growth and different strategies to do that and if you're relying on just paid ads and Google you're screwed 10 years from now like that's not the right game to play by the way I had email and search figured out in 2000 I bought the day Google AdWords came out I bought all the wine terms I own the word wine without a bid up for three days incredible I own and and this was I think it was like 6 to 12 months that the minimum bid was 5 cents not 10 cents on Google and so like I and then you ready for wait this crowd's going to love this you ready for this one1 1999 win library.com over 100,000 emails 91% open rates I remember reading that from from your newsletter it's good to be first this is another thing you're incredible at like you're first to most marke and tactics because I day trade attention I'm never scared in fact uh here's a good one you can imagine given the life I live and how loud I was four years ago there isn't a day that goes by that I don't get 13 questions of so what are you going to do Gary when Tik tok's gone and I'm like grow and they're like what I'm like what do you think's going to happen if Tik tok's banned America all that attention has to go somewhere I believe that X is going to relaunch Vine yes I believe I believe there's four to 50 good entrepreneurs right now building a Tik Tok competitor right now right now because they're like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it the stakes are so high if it gets banned I'm going to crush I think Snapchat spotlights getting better I Believe YouTube shorts will be a winner I believe Instagram and Facebook themselves will be winners but what I know is the ultimate winner will be the best day trader of attention because she or he will spend that first two three four months really getting a sense in the gray cuz it won't show up in the math yet in the gray they will figure out where it's going and they will hit it hard you know what do I say to all those people tough [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and here's why here's why I say tough [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Kip when I hear Gary you don't get it my email my Google search what you just said this sucks this sucks I'm like you know what sucks when you own triaa cleaners in New York and you were the first result in the Yellow Pages under cleaners and then Google and Yahoo came along and killed the Yellow Pages you had a 70-year business cuz you were why do you I don't know if people know this the reason there are so many companies named AAA cleaners AAA landscapers AAA is because the Yellow Pages were the source of finding things and they did it alphabetically and the people that own AAA showed up first how about that for a history marketing lesson probably half the people listening to the show had no idea that was the case so like so to me like you know you know it is what it is do you think do you think that Hershey's is thrilled at Mr Beast made chocolate you think Gatorade is super pumped that KSI and Logan Paul made Prime energy drink do you think that Kmart was happy that Walmart happened do you think that QVC is pumped that Tik Tock shop exists do you think that Hollywood ABC was thrilled that Netflix happened do you think that toysa R Us was happy that Amazon Happ like what are people talking about everything changes all the time always and forever and if you're crying that the thing that helps you make money is changing well then you're a hypocrite of the history of how business works and here's what happened you got fat and lazy yes and you're in trouble yes and and I say this not I say this I hope people hear it like it's it's in it's framed as tough love here's why we can't complain about it because we were the beneficiaries of it at some point in our career I'm not allowed to be mad that email and search got trunked by blogging YouTube and social media it's why I ran at it so hard because I didn't want to be a hypocrite I built the largest wine store in New Jersey because everybody else was doing direct mail and full page ads and newspaper when I outflanked them with a website email and Google so when I sense things were changing I didn't want someone to do that to me by the way it happened to my dad I got busy started doing bner media and became Gary B quote unquote and wines to sold out came out and innovated a deal of the day Groupon style and really took and became the biggest store and took that business from my dad then I got mad cuz I love my dad and I invented wine I invented winetext.com by the way everybody should sign up for it it's crazy and now it's deal the day in text form better deals and even easier you just reply with a number to the text and so like that's what I love about it it's kind of like it's kind of like a Trilogy in boxing right like you don't win every fight you might have won the first one you lost the second one you the third one was a draw like like it is what it is this is the reality of marketing it will forever change what I struggle with is how naive The Fortune 500 companies are of what's happening right now but it tracks with what you said garyan that the CMOS if you're not in the craft and you don't know how things are changing unless your agency turns up one day and has a bad report because for the most part that's that's all they look at right like you actually to really understand how things are changing in marketing you have to be in the craft each and every day you just talked about the thing that bothers me my thing doesn't bother the CMOS bother me but don't bother me what bothers me is the agency landscape I am flabbergasted 15 years in how much agencies incentives do not align with their clients agency incentives are to make TV tv ads and try to win Awards and most companies don't need tv ads and awards are irrelevant and if you look even deeper Kip they sell things that they make margin on oh of course so it's not they make money on upfront buying on TV for sure they make a ton of money on creating television if you're a creative Agency for everybody doesn't know what happens on Madison Avenue you get paid a full year millions and millions of dollars just to think of one commercial you don't even make it you Outsource it to production company literally to think make decks and present and then even worse programmatic digital they make so much money in these block black boxes justified by CPM C like the whole ecosystem is really really pissing me off and it I believe that the reason I'm still building an agency is a little bit based on my superhero syndrome which is a problem and I got to fix it because you know you go too far and you start building resentment that's my personal life and my professional life like I I I really want to tear down Madison Avenue with Vayner media and when I say tear down I don't wish bad on anyone I just believe that the interest don't align enough and I'm hoping that I inspire a lot of kids that are coming out of AD school to build an independent agency and not sell to a holding company because if you sell to a holding company it goes back to what's happening I'm not even mad at the holding companies they're publicly traded companies and they they care about their stock value not about driving business results for their clients and and finally it is the the Coca-Cola and BMW's fault if you're writing the check you're in control they are feeding this bad ecosystem they're the ones that can stop it so yeah for everybody who's listening knowing that there's a lot of people that might be considering getting into the marketing landscape The Fortune 500 marketing thing is a major problem it's built on a book called How Brands grow that was written in 1991 it's the thesis of how companies still run which is right in principle but doesn't take into account the practice iers ship of 2024 reaching frequency and being consistent is beautiful the problem is the world is fragmented people's attention is 9,000 places now and so you need to win on relevance at scale that's how you stay consistent and so that's why I wrote dat trading attention I'm hoping very selfishly but also selflessly that I might write the current Bible of marketing and that's the attempt I'm giving that's awesome well well first of all I I agree with you on the agency model being broken like we work with you all at Vayner on social at HubSpot right Brian and folks on our team we're killing it with you all thank you but like I can't imagine another agency moving and executing and you know this let let's share uh a little bit from behind the scenes that I think will help everyone it is thank you and it's it's starting to go well but you know it takes like I'm sure you've heard from your team I'm reading the notes every week it when you're doing it different it takes a few minutes to calibrate it like it it's not the easiest thing for a HubSpot or anybody else to make transition because it's a different model yeah well you have to move fast and back to your point you have to be relevant at scale and to be relevant at scale you have to say interesting and different [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it offends people and people are a little uncomfortable about it and they don't know how to act and then you get some people who will send you DMS and be like oh I don't know if I like this and you just have to be like well most people do and the people I'm here for and the people I'm here to serve do and that's ultimately what matters I'm not here to make everybody happy I'm here to make companies who are trying to grow and be the next Fortune 500 companies I'm trying to make them happy 100% And you know it's hard it's hard for your most senior constituents I know your Founders very well I'm sure that you know maybe they've seen a post and like uh but then by the way it's hard for my team I always tell my team if we're asking for humility and yes and culture from our clients we have to be the same I had to speak to a creative last week in Asia and said you're doing to our clients what you cry about that our clients do to us because she was like my model our model the model is we need to win on relevance to many different consumers when the client has an idea we need to make that piece of creative with the same Gusto as if it was our own idea and so my team's that it's worse when they're like oh client you don't get it no no every client usually knows their business better than us and then on a flip side you know sometimes it's a senior person but then sometimes it's day-to-day people sometimes it's a 30-year-old who says no to something we're making because it's not on brand in their mind but on brand is to the different constituents not to the subjective opinion of a human right the the the the it's not on brand is like the most awful horrible excuse not to do something this is not on brand is I love you for this this is not on brand is the great weapon of bad marketing right hell yes because it's somebody invoking their political power on the meeting because this is not on brand would be like me saying that I Gary am universally correct in what attractive is great right like like I'm like every human on earth attracted to certain things I'm not attracted in other people and certain things I'm very aware that many people are attracted to those things including my best friends and like I grew up with friends and they were attracted to certain girls and I was attracted to different like that's life this is not on brand would also be saying Lobster is not delicious or I'll give I'll go I'll go more narrow I'm obsessed with west coast oysters Olympia Kumamoto but some people won't even eat an oyster and and then the audacity that you as a human as a brand manager or somebody on the marketing team or social is the only person that knows what's on brand when in fact we are of the moment where we need to be more relevant to many different consumers than ever we're not making a television commercial I'm not interested in debating pink vers fuchsia let's post them both right I mean that what we talk a lot about on this show is that with AI and AI tools gaining steam the cost to ship ideas is approaching zero right like if you if you are obsessed about Pixel Perfect or the perfect idea you're going to lose cuz somebody's just going to out test you and out ship you I just I just don't understand how people don't understand what's going on listen Gary this show is listened to by hundreds of thousands of marketers and Founders every month you have the floor what do you want them to change about how they think about marketing like if you could just let me give a bunch of stuff and then you two jump in on the things that you think the audience will click on more here are many things that need to be digested which are hard to digest number one quantity does not come at the expense of quality hell yes number two if you do not understand how the first second of a video works per platform you cannot be successful on social media AKA how the first second of your video shows up in a Tik Tok versus how it shows up in an Instagram reel is already different and I'm watching many of you not succeed in one or the other or both platforms because you have not understood the science of the art of the first second of a video number three a comment on a social media post today that's clever what I call Cassie comments as creative is a more effective marketing execution than almost every Banner ad billboard radio spot and print ad in the world number four if you do not Market to 40 different 30 different I'll let you get away with 20 different micro consumer segmentations every day 19 to 23y old Hispanic males that live in California that are into skateboarding 40 to 45 yearold moms in Middle America that have teenage boys 60 to 70 yearold men who are in The Last 5 Years of their career that live in Florida that work in B2B SAS 21 to 25y old women that only consume Tik Tok for health and beauty tips on the coasts 150,000 to 300,000 income earning Asian males who are 30 and single that travel a lot if you do not think in the way that I just talked about and have many of them for your coffee for your SAS business for your automotive company for your makeup brand for your fortune 500 5,000 or local flower shop if you do not think in cohorts and then those cohorts are how you wake up in the morning and think about the 10 to 20 pieces of content you're going to put out on social media you already are on your back foot and are losing market share without even realizing it I mean I've got like 30 more let's stop there for a second what of those four rants got you going man I really want to talk I really want to talk about two and and then I actually have a question around Brands versus creators because one of the things we've talked about in this show is the marketing channels growing today favor personalities versus Brands uh let me let me just jump in right there if you don't mind y only because they're better at marketing let let me explain agreed do do lingo which is killing your content as creative [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man that's right that's right like uh they're commenting comments game is great poppy soda is building a multi hundred million doll and as you know it did it through the marketing and micro creators and then the founder started to show up in the content like there's a lot the only reason creators are dominating Brands is because they're better at the marketing right but what are they better at Gary specifically like I think they're more agile they're faster like what what else is it the first the the beats the copyrighting Cassie like the stuff that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matters like they they don't put have you seen what brands put out on social media but isn't it because isn't it because creators don't get the line thrown at them that when they have an idea to put out there they don't have someone thrown the line saying this isn't on brand that is the great killer of creativity and creators don't have that them yes brother and this is why until Corporate America Falls in love with yes and right and actually here's a big one just to and then I'll let you go back to the four things I know we're all over the place cuz I'm having too much fun until Fortune 5000 falls in love with and they will lose they're obsessed with ore they love or eight hours of meetings for or eight weeks of debating or and it makes sense it's their DNA when you had to spend all your money on a television commercial it was smart to spend four or five months on figuring out or right it makes no sense now when your Market here's what people don't I I'll go in there I'll go on my next ramp but okay you said two go ahead Kieran the so I think video is an Ever growing important critical part of like how you market today and actually all of the channels are starting to skew much more heavily towards video like maybe Elon brings Vine back you are a master of video I don't think many people have their videos as res shared as much as you do teach us or teach Brands how to be interested and relevant in video cuz I just think that 90 90 95% should just not do video if they're going to do the videos they're doing today well first I said an important thank you uh for the compliment but this is why I started Vayner media I don't think you need to be pop on I'm aware that I have Charisma and I'm a good communicator I understand that helps me I'm aware I don't have this I'm aware that people some people are just so goddamn beautiful it's hard for us not to watch the video like then there's people who are just so damn knowledgeable right I may be high energy but as you two know that also turns people off there's other people that are very serious and we love it right we like like it cuz it's good information a lot of ways to win on video but let's go back to answer how to make video let me say it nice and slow if I am making cont if I know I'm making content for southern frat dudes 21 to 24 to buy my beef jerky to buy my deodorant to buy my bottled water you can imagine Karen where I'm going this is the new brief the new brief is the consumer segmentations this is how you win on social so if I already know I'm going after that and then this is why this is what I don't know if you guys did you guys get the book did you get the skim it I'm sure you're busy I don't know if you read it or skimmed it you Kip give me it real did you skim it did you read it a little bit like help me understand great when you skimmed it you probably saw like it's kind of text Booky it's like it's definitely deeper than anything I've ever done and it was cuz there was no way for me to articulate what I'm about to articulate so now I know I'm going after 22 to 25y old dudes that went to University of Alabama and were in a frat right and I know I want to sell them deodorant first of all and I know I'm on Tik Tok first of all I know that the thumbnail and the first second is my life Kieran Kip I know that 98% of people do not obsess about the first second cuz 98% of the content I consume every day get Waits 8 seconds to and by the way I do it wrong sometimes too it's like it's hard but it's true it's just like sometimes I do push-ups wrong I know what I need to do but like you know I'm tired like you know and so um the copy the slang Kieran as you can imagine if I know that I'm going after Hispanic dudes in New York who come from Dominican and Puerto Rican families can you imagine the adjectives that I'm going to use in the copy that's going to be different than frat dude like this is what people are not doing right and then I know it needs to not only the first second then around 6 to 10 seconds I need to make sure that I still have them it's Cadence of the video and then are we articulating it simple and then there's just a million things that go into it do I want this just to be brand if it once it goes organically well do I convert it slightly to Performance I'm going to say a very big statement organic social media organic social media posts per day what I call social media ads because if you don't call them ads the industry doesn't take it as serious organic social media ads just posting is this is I'm like pumped to say this on this show is now clearly and Undisputed to anyone who's actually in day-to-day marketing the most important part of every marketing mix in the world and every Fortune 500 company on a good day has it as the 30th most important thing on a good day why why why why why do they think it's I'm with you it is one of the most important important things that we do I don't even think it's close and I'll tell you why Kip I I'll get to answer why but let me tell you why it's not one of the most important it is now leaped to the most important in the last three years we've lived through the tiktock ification of social media every single social media platform right now that has a staggering percentage of the world's attention now works with a four you page mentality including LinkedIn Just Launch theirs meaning the content itself finds the audience for the first time in marketing history the creative creates the Reach This is unheard of I know this is a marketing crew so I can go nerdy the creative creates the reach now when you post organically 20 times a day 15 times a day 12 times a day across 5 to seven platforms might be three of the same videos slightly post-produced per platform cuz on YouTube shorts it'll be a little different than it was on X and different on meta when you do that when the content reaches an over indexing number or a viral number the data is so strong the algorithm is so strong that there is 100% affirmation that there's something there there for consumers so what do you do next as a marketer you then take that individual piece of content and you slightly tweak it in three different ways here are the three things you do everybody once you have a piece of organic social media over index your Norm number one if you sell direct to consumer or on Amazon or walmart.com you take that video and you slightly tweak it and make it a brand formance ad so it was brand at first but now you're post you take back the asset you may add a headline at the bottom that it didn't have before saying on sale you may turn it into a an selling ad you know how on meta that little thing will pop up at the bottom and you can click to the shop you may close with a code you may say go to the click the link in my bio to buy you turn it into performance not just brand okay that's one thing second thing you can do with it and this has becoming one of the most advanced practices of the biggest direct to Consumer Brands and it works for everyone you can spend an ungodly amount of money amplifying that individual ad a video that is a minute or 30 seconds or 50 seconds that is seen by 9 million people on social media is the best commercial on TV and so instead of just letting it die after it's done organically we are seeing Advanced startups call them the hundreds of millions in Revenue still private haven't sold or ipoed spend $1 to5 million amplifying that individual post could you imagine a Fortune 500 could you imagine telling cocaa or or or they got their money all tied up already they don't even have the agility to do doesn't even cross their mind Wendy's would never take a viral Tik Tok and then spend $3 million the way they spend on their National TV ad it's inconceivable that's a practice that will become normal in the next five years or number three one of my favorite things to do we did this with Jimmy Johns you take it that piece of content and that becomes the brief to a campaign what we call six socially informed campaigns so you take an individual piece of content or you do a couple more social media ads that are thematically the same and then you're like wow all of our grandma granddaughter videos Crush now that's the brief let's go make a commercial for Super Bowl or fore pre-roll YouTube long form video that would be our preference over regular television that's marketing now well your your thesis is actually very simple you used to pay millions of dollars to people in offices to guess what people wanted and now you're like hey you have to ship 10 to 15 things a day and out of those you're going to find a handful that are way better than anybody in those offices could have ever come up with not because they're more interesting but they're more culturally relevant they came up with it in the offices this is what I tell all my creative and wi Andis they come from all these fancy places and they're like you know they're a little weirded out cuz's different social I'm like guys girls you're going to be able to come up with every idea you've ever had you can make an ad let me break it down more classic cuz I think you guys will like this this is going to help this is I see this helping a lot of very traditional marketers all that social media ads are every day is like literally doing radio print direct mail and outdoor media and creative every day MH yeah like I I said this the other day and it completely unlocked a cynic in the room in this meeting and she's very I have a lot of respect for her I was like look if your fashion brand 30 years ago could run print ads every day every day every day would you do it if you could have afforded it she goes of course I go that's social media like like I I I believe that what happened is what happened with television television came out it was small it was not in a lot of households when it first came out cuz it was too expensive and every radio copywriter in Madison Avenue [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on the television commercial the television commercial was an inferior status in advertising because the radio and print were classic and more elevated and all that's happening now is the social media ad has taken over the tele ad but the industry is still holding on to yesterday this industry my friends is fascinating it is it is it is romantic about yesterday and it's infatuated with tomorrow three years ago I had people willing to spend $3 million to build a store in the metaverse that had nine people in it and they weren't willing to spend $3 million a year on organic social media creative right well that's because all the Legacy people are telling them that they they don't want to lose the TV budgets right Gary like what if you're a marketer the one of the best things is just hey what are these people incentives that they're selling me and are they incentivized in the old lame way of doing things and if so I should open my eyes up and change to the present best opportunity romantic about yesterday infatuated with tomorrow and we suck at today it's just real life and and let me say this this is not a social media day trading attention is not a social media only game I would buy full page ads in the Wall Street Journal tomorrow if they were $4,000 but they're not I I think I think the Super Bowl is the most underpriced media Buy in marketing in the world at $8 million I will get 110 million Americans to watch 30 seconds of a video it is unbelievably underpriced the problem is if my 30- second video is not good then the whole thing a lost creative is the variable of success nothing I talk about is changed from the history of marketing the history of marketing is reach and frequency and and the creative is the variable of success where's the beef just do it the difference is the mediums have changed and I argue that we have always bought potential reach not actualized reach common sense is not part of people's boardrooms unfortunately I don't believe those Banner ad Impressions I don't believe grps on television I don't believe the PR Company when it's said this got 80 billion impressions in PR it got nine one of the things that's also happening at the same time that you know you you're kind of making the case that that is the number one skilled marketers need to have today we have to get in a little bit of AI it is like one of the passions of this show AI I played with so many tools that will help you do creative help you create video whether they're good or bad right now isn't the point is like this is an minimal viable version today like think about where they're going to be in 2 years time for you phones look like 30 years ago exactly we were using Yahoo web directory before we had Google right like that that's the way to think think about this how do you how do you think about like as a as someone who is a master of the crafted content where is AI fitting into your process oh it's it's an everyday convers the only thing that's holding me up right now is the biggest companies in the world need to be careful with AI creative because I don't believe that the trademark and copyright issues have been settled so if you're mer Mercedes and your agency or you make a full pledge 30 second video from Ai and you run it on television be prepared to get a cease and desist and illegal action from a Disney from a anybody who owns intellectual property it has some real feelings about people siphoning off of their creative wisdom for their own good and nobody has figured out what percentage you know how in music we figured out well if you use 3 seconds of sampling that's okay but more than that's not yeah I'm a little bit concerned that we're in a fiveyear window where we're going to need to figure out a lot of stuff which again is going to favor the entrepreneur these kids they don't care about Disney's not suing Ron in Nebraska right so but behind the scenes making decks for each other thinking using this talk about strategy Kieran when you say strategy like using AI to be a strategy partner is incredible when I exactly here's how my brain works 100% a year ago why is everybody starting to wear ceroid hats again you know I used to literally go to Google and social for that the fact that I can type that in and every day I'm seeing that it's getting better at helping me think I mean this is a big deal I mean it for critical thinkers like myself for people who are naturally prompt Engineers long before they even knew what a prompt engineer was like myself this is going to be a creative Nirvana for people that are the actual creatives the actual creatives are going to win big the people that sat between an actual creative and the market who were doing the secondary creative work the architect is going to win the Masons are a little bit in trouble exactly the Tulin this is a boom for this is what we've argued on the show this is a boom for creators like I I was talking to a marketer over the weekend and trying they were like AI will help or all hype it's not that helpful it's like fine for a research for a blog post but even just a tiny thing where you can have an AI create a hundred variations of something you ask a human to create a 100 variations of something they're out after variation 10 Ah that's too much work it's too too monotonous I don't want to do that I can just say like oh I have this creative idea of a campaign and I can say create a 100 variations of this and you know here are some guidelines to iterate on each creation that alone I just don't think people get it right they underestimate like having something that can do that for me at the click of a button well I got a good one for you wait to the platforms that have all the attention start creating the AI tool Creations for the for the Distribution on their platforms when they have all the information of what works on their platforms right let me say that nice and slow for all the kids in the back right while everybody invests in AI tools and all this stuff they're all going to get completely wiped by the platforms themselves and I'm not just talking social when Netflix has commercials let's just use Hulu when Hulu has all the data of the kind of videos and first seconds and scripts that work on their ad breaks at their disposal to make you your ad they're going to have all the leverage exactly and they're going to create 100 different variations for all the micro segments back to your point Gary and they're going to convert 100% better than the stuff that you were doing before the when I say Don Draper's dead he's dead dead dead dead dead what what do you think that uh so one of the things that Kip and I talk a lot about is the game of inches right that actually most marketers are kind of doing the same sort of stuff and maybe they're all kind of similar in skill sets but the best marketers have discovered like the game of inches the 10% the 15% that they just Excel and Crush everything else so in your next era of marketing like you're pain in the book for it you've written the book for it what is the game of inches what is the to me to excel in the next ER era what should I crush it at like what should I spend my time do I fun do I have a fun answer for this let me give you the game of inches that I've always thought was a yard that is not a new phenomenon that everyone continues to miss and I would call it a blind spot I believe the game of inches especially with the commoditization of many things given AI is coming in other things is this is I believe that almost every marketer on earth when they make marketing comes from such a deep selfish place that the creative is already dead on arrival I love this this is so good I believe the reason I've been able to outflank my inches in every medium in every iteration has been simply this I have never sold anything or made anything that didn't start with the following framework [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my cohorts it starts right here it starts with why on Earth would anybody watch this when I tell you the game of inches is completely based on the selfless selfish framework that is marketing in life it is that my friends when I tell you that the reason everything has worked for me and when I see it work for others here's the biggest problem everybody comes from the including creators I want more followers I want to be famous I want this to go viral the uh couple friends of mine about three years ago when they snipped it out said hey why don't you ever post anything like cool I was like I was like what do you mean they're like like I don't know like when you take private flight to a Jets game or like when you drink a $5,000 bottle of wine or like when you like have dinner like I dinner like I show up and cominging kids in my office but I don't show like the people that are big you know they're like why don't you do that and I'm like cuz it doesn't bring any value to the audience to me when someone takes a photo in a private plane with a bottle of champagne there and a pretty person to their side that they're doing that for themselves they totally are one guy came up to me at a private dinner where we had this talk and I brought this up to this group and he goes you know what G that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's aspirational and I'm like I really don't think it is I think that's the makeup you put on it to justify your insecurity that you need those posts yeah you're just you're just trying to prove somebody in high school that you're cool not that it's actually valuable correct and and I think and I think brands are worse than creators and influencers at this game everything they put out is is for themselves they bring they think very little about why someone would enjoy this and that's why humor tends to historically work in marketing it was like the one place where the selfish Brands and agencies were able to meet the audience right but there's so many other things there's information education there's ponderings there's insights there's wisdoms and there's escapism like Beauty and humor there's bter there's so many things that could work but marketing right now is incredibly not creative I would argue the least creative and I'm I've got my hands in a lot of things I would argue the least creative thing I know right now is Corporate marketing it's so not creative by today's standards it is there's no copy and art director and Senior there's no acds there's no team of creatives that work in a classic advertising agency that are able to make their best work I don't think they're not creative I think they work in companies that suck out their creativity right I believe many of the people that have gone into advertising including my own company came in much more creative than they left right it's because of the one thing you like if you can take one thing from this show it's because they don't start with what you start with which is how do I make something interesting they start with something like this is our rigid brand for style guide this is our rigid brand formula this is what we can and can't say this is our product that we have to promote because that's what we're tasked with right I actually was going through some of them yesterday for fun for different purposes but just a Litany of branded Tech channels that have on YouTube that have like 500 people and like the average video gets you know 100 uh views and they're doing it day in day I putting those things out and like at what point does it drop no one's watching this stuff I I I think the most interesting thing man I think the most interesting thing about this entire conversation and I've been having this conversation for 15 years the most interesting part of this conversation to me personally is for the first time in those 15 years I think shit's about to hit the fan for the you know when I when I was talking about it in 2005 to private companies as why I was getting wine and myself going it wasn't even on people's Radars when I started VOR media in 2009 my brother AJ's laptop literally created the NHL's Twitter and Facebook account Campbell's Twitter and Facebook account my brother literally registered Pepsi's Twitter account literally so you're talking think about how far we've come they didn't even have the accounts but there was never a time in the last 15 years of having this agency that I felt what I believed deeply was about to tip and have that moment and let me explain what I mean by that moment I yelled about Netflix for years in Hollywood to every single CIA executive uh ABC ex like anybody in Hollywood that had power from 200 I don't know 10 to 15 every dinner I had with them is Netflix is going to win this Netflix is going to win this Netflix is going to win this and they completely dismissed it until they didn't everybody who would listen to me in 2014 15 16 17 18 in Hollywood would also get one other thing from me influencers on social media are about to become more famous than famous people and and no one believed me both of those things have now become true and all those people that had those dinners with me are like how'd you know why'd you know what's next I believe that we are within 5 years of the Tipping moment in advertising in Fortune 500 land not because I said so not because of anything else because it's almost over like these brands are getting hurt you got guys know this they're losing market share they've loost especially cpgs they've lost both their advantages they used to have a media Advantage they could spend 50 million on television and kids could spend nothing but now they're spending 50 million 30 million on television kids are doing organic social and getting more awareness than they are this is by the way I'm going to die on this hill I want every Fortune 500 marketer to hear this every single brand that is good at social media organic is getting more actualized awareness Ness actualized awareness than you're getting for your $ 30 to $50 million media spend it's not even close by the way that's number one and number two for cpgs they got another problem you couldn't get into Walmart and Target and Sephora in the past now these brands are getting famous on social and the retailers are going to them and paying them to come in meanwhile they're charging the cpg big Brands to be in their stores in slotting fees and Retail media and these kids are sometimes saying no they can sell enough on Amazon or Shopify I don't know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people are thinking but Carnage please google it if you do not know this word I know you all do Carnage Carnage is coming and there's such an easy way to stop it take organic social media creative seriously because even in the way I broke it down earlier there's something I didn't touch on and I'm glad I got to this rant the consumer insights that come out of making a lot of social media ads a year are worth the price of admission K Kieran do you know why Vayner media is the fastest growing independent agency of all time we have better consumer insights than everyone cuz we make so many social media ads 20% of them are made just to secretly ask a question to get insights from consumers I love that hell yes Gary thank you over everybody I wanted to say that a new book is coming the followup to jab jab jab right hook originally called jab jab jab left hook but I finally captured what I've been doing for the last 20 years as an entrepreneur as a Creator and influencer as an operator of a
