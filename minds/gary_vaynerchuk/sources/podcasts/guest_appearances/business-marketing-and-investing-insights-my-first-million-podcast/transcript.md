# Business Marketing and Investing Insights — My First Million Podcast

there is a little concern for me of what happens when this no longer becomes the remote control of our society if you told me that 16 years from now we live in a predominant VR world I would be like maybe like I can see that possibility you could see that it's pushing in a direction I don't think it's going to end up being these Apple Pro Google Glass snap the Facebook thing Quest my intuition is that it's going to have to be much more lightweight but I never underestimate the human being I'm positive somebody's going to make the contact lenses that work like this and then We're Off to the Races cuz now back to the way I think about day trading attention this no longer houses the attention attention is the number one asset Gary what's going on man how are you I think Sean um Sean I I've known you for a while I've watched your videos forever Sean saw something recently that you had posted that I thought everyone knew about you Sean what was that thing the report card most podcasts start with an intro we start with little ball busting so I have here Gary's High School report card which you tweeted out to be fair so I'm not I'm not putting out there you didn't already do but I thought this is kind of amazing so you tweeted out a picture of your high school report card I'm just gonna read off a few uh few of your achievements Gary got a a c in Ceramics a D in English an F in German uh PE you got an A that's the only a you have on this report card I think uh algebra D this one's kind of amazing speech which like you are known for speech you got a D drivers at D Gary you were uh what a turnaround what a turnaround what's your reaction when you see this that um a lot of data in the world is dirty it's fake data and um I think school grades are just not a tremendous indicator of what's going to happen the speech one is crazy the the report card I I tweeted out was the recap of all four years of high school the so little fun facts to build on top of what you just said I got an F in all four marking periods of German one freshman year I retook it sophomore year I got a D in the first marking period and then proceeded to get all FS failed language my freshman in sophomore year and in the state of New Jersey in 1994 if you did not pass two years of language you could not graduate high school so I walked into junior year high school and took Spanish one with all these ninth graders as a junior and had the pressure on and luckily I got Mrs Senora Kennedy saw something in me and forced me through the system otherwise it was over for me um but yeah I mean the speech one really stands out to your point Sean right like to think that I got a D in speech which was give a speech in class right um which I did well it's just that I you know I told my M my mom and I talked about this this weekend I literally did not open a book in four years of high school and did zero homework like you know they would everyone who's listening went through school I think like they would assign a book report and like it's not that I did it poorly it's that I didn't do it just like did never I literally in four years of high school did zero homework zero like I something happened where I just knew that you know at that point High School I was already working in my dad's liquor store and selling a lot of baseball cards at shows and just kind of and it was look this is pre- internet the world was different I grew up in an immigrant family we lived in like we just moved to like rural New Jersey when I tell you we lived in our own little four five person cocoon my family we really did it was very very very in hindsight deeply immigrant you know what I mean like we didn't have like Amer like my parents didn't have American parent friends like my mom wasn't friends with any of my high school friends parents like my mom asked me about what I'm doing for college February of my senior year I was like Mom it's over I'm not going to college she lost her mind and forced me to like go and I got like a postcard in the mail from Mount Ida College filled it out and that's literally how I went to college like so you know I think if I was growing up today my intuition is that it would have been okay for me not to go to college and it would have just all been handled differently and honestly ly I think my teachers would have said to me like I have a bright future instead of saying what they did back then which was you're a loser you're gonna be a garbage man that was the big thing Sean Sam in the 90s your teachers would tell you you're gonna be a garbage man which I think is really crazy because actually it's a very good living with a high P you has a high P scale our friend just started a garbage business and he's doing like 300 Grand a year of jokes on you Miss Kennedy yeah even if you don't do like if you don't build a business and you work for the the the city it's like a well-paying job in comparison to Alternatives nonetheless you're like uh by the way the thing that would have been more effective is they said you're going to end up a high school teacher unfortunately that would be a brutal burn for the themselves it's really it's really wild like that was I I was my mom did such a good job and like I was very respectful even though the teachers weren't reciprocating but I used to think like that I used to be like huh I'm make I'm selling ,000 in sports cards a weekend right I'm making a thousand in profit I'm like if I only did this right I'm making $52,000 a year and I also knew that I was in school [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all day every day you know what I mean and I was just like man like I make more money in theory than my teachers there's something there's a disconnect but I didn't think of it like arrogant right I wasn't like razing or a dick I was just not confused I was intrigued I was just like had this incredible calmness starting in fifth grade that like all of this is not real and like let me just get through it and then my real life will start and like to this day I really do think the first day I worked at Shoppers Discount Liquors then Wine Library like when I came home from college that like May 19th you know 1998 that d i and I came home and stayed with my parents for a couple months before I got an apartment closer to the store um I would argue that that day that Monday you know May 18th 1998 is still outside the birth of my CH like top five days of my life because there was like this I actually remember it vividly I was my parents lived 45 minutes from the liquor store you know drive on Route 78 in New Jersey and I just vividly remember coming from like the back you know Woods of where my parents lived onto the highway this was it Z100 was on like the morning Zoo like I got a coffee at the like at the you know the gas station and I just like literally literally exhaled like 12 years of anxiety and I was just like literally like worded to myself like now my life begins and I I was hyped and and it's you know you guys see it publicly now I'm passionately excited I'm very fortunate I live a life where I like what I do and you know a lot of people don't have that luxury and I I make a lot of content and talk a lot about it because it was it was really one of the best days of my life well I want to ask you a little about that uh in a bit but there's one thing I wanted to start with which is you're very intentional and so when I was prepping for this I wrote down my intent I was like you know but before I write any of the notes or the background or the questions I want to ask is what's the intent what are we here to do and um I wrote down the following so I just want to read this out loud to you because I feel like sharing my intent I think you will get it and it will help I said what I want this episode to feel like I said I want this to feel like I'm people get to feel like what it's like to hang out with Gary ve not interview Gary ve I like um trading stories dinner and drinks Vibe conversation not interview the audience leaves feeling like they just chopped it up with Gary Vee um not here's what I don't want to do interview him ask him the same old questions about the same old topics which will trigger him to just go into autopilot because nobody can help it if we do that that's our fault and the audience will feel like he's talking at them so I wanted to say that out loud mostly as a reminder to myself because it's my job to make that happen but also because you're big on intention and being being very intentional and I wanted to actually reference one more thing about high school which is I sent this to a buddy who had interviewed you on a different podcast I said any any tips anything you you would say uh that would help me out here because this is a big deal Gary Vee's coming on the show and said give me some some advice and he just said he he read what I wrote and he goes Brendan wariki I didn't know who that was and he goes I heard heard him say once that growing up he didn't have anyone to talk about business with he goes your show is that for like half a million entrepreneurs it's the person who you could just chop it up about business they nerd out about business in the same way that you do for him that was Brandon wari I never heard this guy's name before but I guess it's your friend growing up ready for this ready for this go for you're gonna love this one minute I'm gonna show it to you visually one minute be uh let me I'm going to show you the exact time at this is what's at 12 which is when I came on this is me replying to Brandon wari who right now is in Germany buying wine from my family's wine store and I literally talked to him 13 seconds before I literally one second before I turned on the link to be on with you twoo and so great great call by your buddy I met Brandon the first day of high school we had home room together I sold him some Hensley bamb bam muin rookie cards within the first week of meeting him which feels very very appropriate and he was the kid that I did baseball card shows with and somewhere around senior year of high school I'm like man I really want Brandon to work with me because I knew I was going to build this big company for my dad's liquor store he got a job with MCI World whatever it was called at the time the Telecom company and I was devastated and then the business God smiled down on me they went out of business like actually out of business like a that Enron fraud sock and and he hit me like six months into me starting and he came over and I speak to Brandon maybe more than anyone in my life he's truly family to me in a way that like I feel about my brother and sister AJ and Liz and so he's uh I've got a lot of great stories with him and um we you know as any best friends we recall them all the time and some of them are just we did a b how long how long you been working with them then since uh like you're 18 or 20 or whenever whenever High School ended yeah 20 well it was a college when I wanted so we've been working together since we were 22 some 48 so 26 years and you know it's uh you know what's cool about friendship is it's different than family right you choose it and you know I I I get very emotional it's funny I really know how I feel about Brandon because the only time I get choked up is usually when I like the most often time where I like get emotional is if I'm like being honored at like a charity event as you guys know I put out a lot of stuff one of the things that actually is very quiet in my life is my nonprofit work I got very affected when I was coming up the game that I saw a lot of people that weren't great people using charity as like a makeup to who like like a reputation laundering it's a really good way I love that term Sam I've never heard that that's exactly right brother and so I got very weird I think I got so affected by that I'm actually CH I'm saying this out loud to challenge myself myself to be a little louder of what I do on petel of promise or or you know charity water or all these different things I'm doing because I do think it ins I do recognize that inspires people to like consider more charitable work but I for a long time was quiet about it anyway not to Sidetrack when I would get an award or be honored at these dinners I would the or in the wine business when I was getting Awards it's only on that stage when I'm thanking my family that I kind of get emotional only in that set not once in a while in a podcast especially if I talk about my mom or dad um but Brandon gets me too like I it's it's come up now a couple times in the last couple years and so I love him deeply he's the salt of the earth he um he's just a good dude and it's been my best friend for a long time and we've done a lot of baseball card shows together and a lot of selling wine together it's been a lot of fun well one of the things that me and Sam and that's kind of how me and Sam got together is basically we both he's my Brenda wari right he's the guy I can chop it up with about business and and just talk nerd out about it one of the things we do is always just what are you excited about like what products are you seeing what people are you seeing what cool stories are you seeing that are kind of that you're genuinely excited about and even though that didn't sound like a podcast that's what this podcast became it started off tra traditional interview show and we did like you know 20 episodes like that kind of playing the part and then all of a sudden one one day I just grabbed Sam on a Friday and we just started shooting the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about like dude have you seen this or hey I've started using this thing it's awesome or I think this is going to be big and that became that's when the podcast actually took off and so I kind of wanted to do the same thing with you because you're you're you're always seeing stuff yeah it's honestly bro that's the podcast I should be doing right like I'm so co-host List have you guys seen have you guys have you guys seen break the web what's that no what's that I like this thing so I'm just going to go into it with you guys and jam as we're jaming this app's got my attention trending topics on TW was so big for me back in the day when it was desktop only I would look at it constantly I feel like I was really on top of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and so this you know break the web is an app dude they got a great tagline so it's uh breakthe web.co the internet's official scoreboard if you look at it again like it's just what's trending right now and it seems like the underlining Tech is pretty damn strong like like you know how everybody loves to throw around AI or this and that and you're like if you're smart you're like this is a collection of apis or anything like this one's a little bit better and like I don't know I've put on my home screen which is not something I've done in a long time why dude also the design of that was pretty sick I like how they did why did I put on my home screen Sam no like why uh why do I like it well yeah I mean it's like I'm looking at it now you just showed it to me it was a lot of new stuff I don't really pay attention to I don't like your yours I saw the word uh Gaza Trump and like five other words where they're important but like I don't I'm not going to like I'm the same it's ironic first of all great observation brother for me as well like honestly something that's on my mind is everyone needs to consume less news because all it does is push fear and negativity and like it's just so scary like how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up that is so it's funny saying brother I don't really click into that stuff so right now it's brand new and when I met with the founders I only met with them for like 10 or 15 minutes I asked them real quick I'm like can we get this categorized out and they're like yeah that's on the road map like I just want need pop culture and consumer Trends so like to me um I'm like when I look at Madonna fan I'm like what is that you know Madonna mistakenly scolded a fan again right now what they're what what's interesting though is it's a great indication of where we are in society like back to when tw Twitter trending topics in 2008 seven excuse me seven and s89 it was less political and and it was really valuable like the reason I it or the potential of it and obviously we're in a election season so now this will get eaten up to your point Sam on this stuff but it is an indication of the pulse like I'm always looking for what's the indication of the pulse of what people give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about dude so these guys are it looks like it only has 90 reviews oddly both of these guys used to work at a bakery the CEO worked at peep coffee the other guy used to work at Specialties Cafe and Bakery so they're both uh lovers of baked goods and then they decided to launch this it's it's 3 years old though but it's not popular yet what so what are what's your prediction this thing is going to be here I think it was something else three years ago um but my prediction is not even that it so it's funny there's no prediction back to shooting the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to your point Sean I'm not overly like oh break the web is going to be the best the concept of day so I have a new book coming out soon uh this year right I finally feel like I've synthesized what I actually do like if I what's it called day day trading attention you know like like to me uh Twitter long for video I have a meeting today on it again back to like Sean great job of setting this up like I'm in full like let me give this audience everything I got at the second mode let go so long form Twitter I think literally have a meeting today where I'm gonna post as as you know Dustin like we're gonna post my 100 most successful YouTube videos on Twitter here over the course of the next couple months try to stagger a little bit because just very clear that Twitter is it's going to push it right and so like when I think back to the simplic I don't know if that's going to work I think I I agree they're pushing it but I just don't find myself using it that way yeah that's a great call Sam like what I know is that I'm I never have an interest in guessing if something's going to work I have an interest in executing on anything that might work and then dealing with the ramifications of The Upside why guess when you can test for cheaper than it almost cost to guess right like it's not expensive to Take Your Best YouTube videos and re have somebody repost that's a easy way to learn uh because you know you talk about day trading attention but all trading is mispriced assets that's right so where where can you buy something that's worth more and and I would argue that attention is the most mispriced asset right now that most impacts everyone right the universal make that argument right what's that Sean I said make that argument so why why is that there is nobody that will ever listen to this that doesn't need attention as a currency to achieve what's in their stomach whether they want to raise money for their PTA be president of United States get more listeners to their podcast sell their sneakers they the only asset class that I think is universal is attention even a parent trying to home parent to children need their kids to listen to them to be able to get the message across the currency of listening is or consuming is is profound and we're living through the mass fragmentation of that right if you think about let's use parenting was a lot easier to get your kids to listen when in 1954 80% of fam sat down and had dinner together and for like an hour and a half and you did it right and like so those parents were able to message in a very interesting way uh whereas now they still can we have technology you can send a text or a salm and Sean clip to your kids to get them to think of something but there's also so much Supply in right with the demand side being the same there's only so many hours in a day now the human brain I think has capacity to keep a lot more information than we think nonetheless um for me more narrowly as someone who it loves business and loves you know to think about it you know it doesn't matter what you're selling and it doesn't even matter what you're saying until you first get their attention and then everything is about what you're saying right what's interesting to me is I think of it the acronym I use in currently at Vayner X Vayner media is uh pack platforms and culture right and so break the web plays in culture right like there's two different currencies that I think about constantly or two different Frameworks one is platforms what is what are the top 25 platforms that have people's attention doing what do they care about from snap to Pinterest to LinkedIn to YouTube even within themselves YouTube shorts differently than YouTube this Collective of like 15 20 places right that really have quote unquote the attention what are they up to how do their algorithms work what are their features doing and I think about them on a day-to-day basis right and then and then I think about culture like what is the slang what is what is the things of interest the people of Interest right um and and then it becomes a framework of like what's overpriced and underpriced execution so for example I think Super Bowl is the most underpriced media in the world it's very hard to get 130 million people to watch 30 seconds of a video at and actually want to and pay attention to it right so that 78 million Vig I think is great the problem is the creative is the variable of success right so the media might be a great deal but if your 30 second video is forgettable or stinks or you overpaid for making it right Verizon paid Beyonce to be in that commercial if they paid her $500,000 I think they stole her if they paid 40 million I think they overpaid for her I don't know what the number is my guess is it's somewhere in between but that is basically my brain works and how I think about communication and marketing and brand building and perception changing and just the whole world it's how I think about the world have you guys SE let me tell let me ask if you guys have seen this in terms of cool [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so uh perplexity is awesome um but they have this new thing I didn't see them talk about it a lot it's called perplexity AI SLP podcast they've come out with a daily podcast that's 5 to 10 minutes long that's written by perplexity and it has beautiful background music and they've got this British guy have you ever seen those like planet Earth videos where it's like now we see the mother cheetah go after yeah they've got this voice that sounds exactly like him reading like the script and it sounds awesome the voice is powered by this thing called uh 11 Labs dude I went to 11 Labs Sean I uploaded a ton of our voice and I was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it let's just see if I can make a podcast it's way it's like it's the best thing I've ever heard have you guys seen that come out with this podcast and seen if you ever want to see Sam speak Hindi 11 Labs made a clip they just translated the podcast Auto auto dubbed it using AI into Hindi and it's phenomenal by the way it's something we've been working on for about a year like I'm I think next year is the full year where like every single thing I do every video every language like we there I haven't I haven't seen Sam I haven't seen the podcast but I just took not like I can't wait to listen to it like look that it's so good and they've not made a big this has not been like a big hoop they haven't done I I randomly came across it I was listening to it I'm like I'm going to listen to every day this is great it's David atbo telling me about like the news it sounds awesome uh which Lang which language you going to do should we do Hindi is that the one I'm doing everything like yeah if you're gonna do one you might as well do all yeah just like I just think that I also think like the everyone's going to go after the big one like for example I get excited about Portuguese I'm like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it everyone's G to go to Mandarin and Hindi and like the big number you know I'm like I'm just GNA own Portugal and Brazil like you know just like but but that's tongue and cheek I think the it is over the next three years all of it's going to go down and cost so much that it won't even like the the US in seven years are gonna laugh that we ever had it just in one language and they won't even understand they're like dude have you ever seen that talk that this guy Alex Schultz gave about Facebook's growth he was the he was the top Facebook growth guy like early on he when they created the growth team it was him chamath and uh the guy I think Javier who now runs it and he's like he put a chart up and it was a it was a yissy yissy talk and he puts a chart up on on the screen he goes um every like there's a bunch of dots he's like you know all these dots are feature releases and you can see one dot where everything starts growing right after that he goes anyone want to take what take a guess what that that dot is people in the audience like photos photo tagging um it's uh when you release mobile with you know what is it we don't know and he's like language translation local language translation he goes the biggest growth driver in Facebook's growth Bar None was when we when we localized the service which he's like was not easy they actually I don't know if you know this Facebook had to do like a Wikipedia thing because there was you know there's 186 countries that they had to deal with and so they were like we need users to basically re retranslate the site for their local region and they incentivized people to do that and that's how they Mass translated overnight no other social network did this and it took off so that was the first time I heard about this the second was when we did um our our basketball camp with Mr Beast uh which Gary I invited you to you got to come next time um Mr Beast basically we host a basketball camp at his house and he did this presentation he's like he's like here's one thing I'm doing that nobody else is really doing which is every video I do I now created channels in Portuguese and everywhere else and he's like not only do I translate it I hire a like a voice actor who's famous in the country like like the Spider-Man of Brazil told me Jimmy told me that whole thing several years ago like it's it's exactly right but by the way tell me about this basketball camp because I'm playing basketball tomorrow at 6: a.m. like this is how much I love it I'm 48 like I really should and I'm and I'm I'm 5 foot eight you'll fit right in we got there's plenty of wheelchairs and ice bags of ice I'm ready but I'm 90s Nicks fans so no easy layups is that is that politically correct in this basketball camp yeah yeah you can you can hack your hack your heart away it's all good we um yeah actually I wonder if you do anything like this so um we do this thing where it's called Camp MFM with my first million MFM so we um we were like we like the idea of getting together like you know when you go to a conference you end up having a good time if you go speak somewhere you end up having a good time but there's kind of this dread in my stomach of like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yet another conference like I just don't want to do the boring I just I guess have a resistance of doing the same thing everyone else is doing in general and so we were like how do we get the benefits of going and networking without ever calling it networking or a conference or anything else and so we created basically an adult summer camp it was like What If for a weekend we just rented a house and in this case we actually just stay at Mr BEAST's house now because he he ended up wanting to come and so we we go to his house and then we bring in a trainer from the NBA he treats us like we're you know washed up NBA players basically puts us through their program and we just play ball all day and there's no business talk during the day because it's all just like overly competitive out of shape guys 20 guys that's it um so when is it small groups we do it once a year so we'll just happened but it was big like the founder of Airbnb Mr Beast all these guys Brian and the no jo Joe gab Joe's the best Joe I have an email from Joe that says Gary we're fans we want want you to look at our company and it was Joe a bedandbreakfast.com and I never saw it you know or maybe I did and just like but I look at that email I have it on a separate laptop and I look at it what once in a while just to like I love it I like this is actually a fun segue back to chopping it up if it was just us three and everyone's this where we're going yeah where do you guys sit on losing so we just talked about basketball so I just think about me going to this basketball thing and like my favorite thing in basketball in pickup is to lose the first game it is my favorite and I talked about this on Steve Bartlett's podcast like got a billion [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] emails about this there's something that just like the blood in my head like everything transforms in my chemicals and then everything in life like everything stops and the only thing that matters to me in the world is that we have to win game two that's so funny you said that when we did the camp the same thing happened uh the very first game I'm trying to be the host of the event so I'm like okay yeah yeah you guys play I'll sit out first no problem we get in I'm like I'm passing the ball I'm like oh that's Joe gbia let me not let him drive I'm not going to try to hurt the founder of Airbnb Mr Beast oh that was cool man you know I see someone taking a video I'm like that's cool that's gonna be a cool clip that's gonna go viral then I'm like wait [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that I'm in the clip he's scoring on me and I was like he's no longer Mr Beast that's Jimmy and that's Joe and now we're competing to win and then the whole event got a lot more fun when it equalized correct everybody all the job titles dropped and it's basically who's here to win who's here to play and uh that's when it got real it's why I love entrepreneurship where I was where I'm going with this is that email like excites me you know like I'm like yeah eat it Gary like dude that one would have been a bigger one for you than uh Uber too no it wouldn't have maybe but no because I was the they both probably believe it or not this is how much startups were back then they both would have been priced between four and 8 million that's crazy right I know bro I got into tumblr's B B series B not Angel not seed not series a I got into tumblr's series B this is actually it right here this is my Twitter Tumblr Facebook stock I got into tumblr's series B at a $14 million valuation that's like 2006 S8 it's just like five billion years AG by the way back to that mispriced assets again right Sean Sam this is actually a good Insight that was literally 2007 or eight right we're only talking 16 years ago so like you guys are young dudes so think 16 years ahead how old will you be in 16 years Sean dude I don't want to know 52 50 I don't know how old am I right honestly no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't know if you guys hang out with like 60 70 80 year old business people like I do a lot of that because it's the best I mean to me the two extremes are the best right hang out with the 17 year olds that are like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] listening right now [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on all of us saying these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are going wait till they see what I'm going to do and then 73 year olds who are like just like the amount of 67 60 forget I think is like literally children 70 and 80 to me 70 and 80 to me just it's stunning to me how many 73 75 77 year old businessmen and women I know that go at it because they love it it's still what they do and it gets me excited because at 48 it's like man I'm still like I'm in halftime right like I'm me like it makes me you know I get excited about that I wanted to ask you about that so I think you and I kind of have similarish backgrounds where it was like raised around like like kind of a rough crowd every once in a while and still kind of have a little bit of that where like I enjoy like doing like hood rat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] every once in a while same and uh but like I've been I've had some success and I'm hanging out also with like you know guys like like uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Sam's nickname on the Pod is hose water cuz he's just no water baby just drinking straight out the hose so he's Sam hose water par dude I loved man hose water was the best it's the best dude I drank out of the hose literally from 1982 to 1989 dude I I I I peed in the backyard more than I peed in the toilet 100% yeah they used to call me lookman no hands like every day uh so listen I had a question so you uh so look we kind we're all three probably a little bit similar where it's like we kind of like did a bunch of Scrappy stuff and now Gary you're older and a little and further along in your career in terms of success than we are but we've both both done some interesting or we've all done interesting things where we're able to hang out with some of these guys who are like legitimate billionaires I'm I'm sure you're I don't know if you are or not but you're in that you're in that ballpark and I see with Michael Rubin and whatever you you know you hang out with some of the the shot callers of the world what's been the what do you think is the difference between the store owner who's doing like you know a retail guy doing half a million or a million dollars a year uh the 10 million year business the $100 million do net worth person and the billion dollar net worth person do they all like is it is it do they all have similarish mindsets just maybe luck or industry they picked a right a different industry or they're just significantly more determined they're significantly higher risk taking have you noticed any Trends between the gap of su successful people because a million dollar net worth for a six-year-old who started a store that's dope billion yeah two things it's it's everyone's attention and 1234 doesn't the 1234 is just so cool anyway should we make a wish real quick I I don't know we should make a wish but we should start a trend and try to make 1234 matter for entrepreneurs um uh that's a really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fun question Sam my brain as you were asking it goes immed was focused on one two three four well yeah I just have to look over and see it I always thought about 1234 I've always thought it was interesting that it has no pop culture relevance um I believe the first thing that goes through my mind on this question is risk tolerance and fear right so I think it's fear I just had an idea 1234 I got I get it I I I want I got to use it 12:34 should be where you shoot your shot I love that when when you see 12:34 that's when you got to send that text you got to send the Tweet you got to send the email right there that that's that's the idea for 12:34 we can make this a thing can you get somebody to register like 1234 or I feel like you know um I don't want these Hustler kids like the 13-year-old me would listen to this and immediately register 1234 always do that uh um uh I I think it's fear I think I think about my dad a lot my dad I think it's how people view their ability to go backwards so I think that there's something very scary about my chemicals and Sam I've always felt this in you as well it's funny that you brought it up I don't know if you I don't know you well enough to know this and I'm not even sure you're GNA believe me when I say it but I do think you have a good shot of understanding what I'm about to say my favorite Rocky is Rocky 6 when he goes back to Philly with nothing yeah Sean there's something so weird in me and it's almost like am I sandbagging myself like I be I'm going to be very vulnerable here like I don't view it as like I'm cool I actually view it as I'm potentially flawed right like there's something in me that romanticizes being okay with it all falling down I'm back in like queens in a you know $400 a month apartment the entire internet is like see he was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] overrated I told you know all the people that love me all the friends they have that don't love me are like see your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guy was a loser he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up he sucks I don't know why I like that but I believe Sam to answer your question it's something to do with that chemical I believe the people that I think you brought up some good stuff I think a lot about if my dad had a supermarket instead of a liquor store I would have taken that to way bigger Heights cuz liquor was you couldn't ship it and you know like there's a like the Lu component yeah there's a ton of serendipity like honestly I think a lot about if my dad didn't want me to work in his store I would have went to because I fell in love with tech I might have went to California who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] knows what have I created in 95 678 like could have had one of those Mark cuin moments I think about that or you know like I think when you can sell when you can for all the everyone who's listening and if you have kids like this if you can sell you're in the game right like if you can sell you're you'll never be like zero right and so what do you got here how do you want it is 1234.com available no dude 1234 is owned by like a t yeah that's what I figured that's imposs I like the one like the 137 yeah do that um are you kidding me dude I love that that was so dope I'm so bumped about this bro the funny thing by the way Ben my guy he he texted us a screenshot of GoDaddy one it's 234. org 15,000 he just said pull the trigger question mark no no don't don't don't pull that one we're actually it's a good one I never think you should overpay for names because I think names are made McDonald agree I agree right Sam like but you know who disagrees [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] U daresh daresh I know I know dude I've been with them multiple times so daresh uh founded HubSpot which bought my company and I've gotten close with them he's like he's like dude I bought chat.com or yeah chat.com today I'm like why he goes because it was available I was like what are you gonna do with it he's like I'm not sure but I'm gonna figure something out but I paid eight figures for it look he's smart he knows like that you know look as long as do I mean to me the scary thing for let me let me take a step back not go too fast he's smart enough to know he could probably flip that cuz it's a very very very big deal on the and he's got stupid amounts of money correct which is amazing on the flip side there is a little concern for me of what happens when this no longer becomes the remote control of our society right like I'm very fascinated by 20 years from now talk about 16 years ago on tum 16 years from now if you told me that 16 years from now we live in a predominant VR world I would be like maybe like I can see that possibility right you could see that it's pushing in a direction I don't think it's going to end up being these Apple Pro go you know Google Glass snap the Facebook thing Quest my intuition is that it's going to have to be much more lightweight but I never underestimate the human being I'm positive somebody is going to make the attention now it's housed here whoever controls that Paradigm wins big and then all of a sudden does.com even matter in that is that how the uiux works because do com didn't matter at all in 1990 dude that's how I feel about SEO businesses right now well that's exactly what happened if it's chat GPT and and Google that's why Vayner media never did search when I started the 14 years ago everyone's like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] why don't you do search and I was like first of all I thought if I built a very big company I'd be able to m&a search if I wanted to add it right it was already established I grew up on search the decade the 15 years before and so here's a good one for the kids if you're building towards the future if you're capable remember that you can always buy the current and that's how I thought about search I was going to master social in o9 and I felt like social was going to eat up search anyway and I think it's starting to happen now like search is in a weird spot like Google's in a weird spot like in it's in a great spot in some ways but yeah I think I think search is definitely a different world like if your business I actually spoke to somebody Thursday um who uh is really getting hurt because he was one-dimensional on search and I I you know that's such a fear of mine that if you sell your stuff via email via your p via social media content via search you must develop into a Swiss army knife because if you're just a fork if you're just onedimensional you're gonna get caught hey Gary let me ask you about that you you were saying a second ago you're like I'm not afraid to go back yes um do you so like the way that I run my personal finances is I've got like uh my safety net so I've got this like account that has enough money that I'm good forever and and so that's in Vanguard bonds and like I've never touched that and then anything anything above that amount I I'll bet it and I'll like start new [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and so you're talking about like you don't mind going back but but it sounds like that's not exactly how you'd run your your finances so do you have like a safety nut and then anything above that you're like bet it bet it bet it or do you just use profits from Vayner to to make these bets what how do you how does that work yes um I have I'm going to be uncomfortably transparent my I'm very fortunate so my zero is a million dollars but that's it that's it Sam wait so you only keep a million in your like liquid portfolio that's your safety no no no I have I have other things like I have money in all sorts of places but I have this one place that has $1 million and literally everything else is in play wow now Sean I want to paint a very clear picture here because I don't want to create hyperbole I haven't bet everything on everything but if I ever feel the way I felt about Facebook in 2007 when I put I had $236,000 in savings put 200,000 into Facebook right if that ever happens again like I'm willing to bet very large because that feeling similar to the feeling I felt about the internet when I saw it in '95 similar to the feeling that I felt about friender myspace that little like oh the internet's changing I look for those moments um and you know again I'm willing to go big but to your point Sam like it's not like I'll go to Zer zero you know a million dollars is a lot a lot of money and especially if you're capable if you're capable like I don't know like I feel very conf and a reputation yeah correct I also think about Faceoff like where you change like I I have like these very like deep Sean it goes back to like wanting to win the basketball game like I think it's more I think the worst thing for my love of Entrepreneurship that's happened is what Sam just said I no longer can do it without anyone knowing it's a whole different game it was so fun when people didn't know what what you're saying reminds me of uh well two things I think it's super interesting that your answer to what's the difference you've seen in the mindset and the psychology was who's willing to go backwards and almost what you said was you almost kind of crave there's like a romantic idea about going back which I like a lot I resonate with that a lot it's almost like there's TV shows I wish I could go watch again for the first time in the same way like there there's no greater feeling than going from not making it to making it once you've made it and you try to make more it doesn't have the same thrill Adventure satisfaction self-respect you have to almost go into different games like I I worry about that like I don't let me rephrase I don't worry about it but I I sense that there's a day where I actually I talk a lot about never retiring and dying at my desk and then there's an equal part of me that realizes that I'm very wired in a way where I just might make wake up at 79 and be like you know what like I'm done I'm just going to focus on my grandchild's like like I just I don't know I have like I think we're all very like I think we underestimate how long life is you know I think we underestimate our capacity to make hard decisions to different directions that we can't see along the way then there's back to luck and you know I mean look we' lived through a lot of prosperity the everyone the three of us have gotten very fortunate of where we lived during what era right like there's a lot going on in the world like you know there was people in the Roaring 20s talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like this over dinner and then you know a very challenging 30 years punched them in the face right it all seemed so great in 1927 America was on its way it's going to be awesome and then you know a massive World War and the atomic bomb and Korea and Vietnam and so social unrest and so you know all these things are like fun to think about it's like fun to like romanticize about the future um but I I will say this I'm actually GNA ask you guys this what do you think your personal relationship is with gratitude versus taking for granted my my my I I changed on that once I actually sold my company and was financially free and then like 2 weeks after the SED the company the CEO got into a life-threatening accident and I was like oh that could have ruined my deal and like like every like this all could have been ruined and then I like hit like some threshold I'm like dude I did not work any harder than anyone else who else like who have done similar things but failed this is 100% luck and I'm so grateful that I like it just has worked in my way in many ways I feel like I I am the luckiest guy around and it just seems like I'm so gracious for the luck that I have that's it's kind of it's changed more to I've just been gifted this and I I'm so lucky and I'm thankful good for you Sam Sean where you at with it I have a different so to me I'm like all right I think people make a mistake they're grateful in the macro so if you say to somebody you're like what are you grateful for almost everybody uh my family my health and and to me this is the I'm not saying they're wrong obviously those are great things but it's sort of like when a company says our values are integrity and excellence it's true but not useful it it basically has leaves no register and so I try my focus is how do you be grateful in the micro meaning can I be if if I'm in an elevator can I find something in that moment can I get a rep a practice rep of gratitude in that because that actually shifts me when I can take a breath be grateful for the fresh air I can look at something my kid is doing and how silly they are and and just in that moment find something and if I could do that you know 10 times a day that is you know uh I think that's how micro antidote yeah I think that's how micro and macro and micro work together I really do think of it as being alive like just thank you for that I'm not that I didn't die last night right like I and I to your point I think when your macro is that I think you're actually I think I love what you said you're just talking about applying yeah that's how I apply it exactly that's my that's my relationship with it right but like if you're getting to that place that's how I live I'm like like literally like it's like a nice sunny day in New York today and I'm just like yeah like that's awesome right you know like like just choosing positivity like I think people have been so sucked into like focusing on what they don't have or what what's not going well um I mean Naval has an amazing definition of Happiness by the way I don't know if you've ever heard this he goes happiness is what you feel when you don't feel like anything's missing in your life yeah right people think happiness is something you got to achieve something you got to go create something you got to get it's like you know you think you need to accumulate things to have happiness and he's like actually it's just when you're not focused on What's Missing well that's right I think I think Simplicity is just so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man it's so right like but you don't your your your life is not simplistic uh I mean I don't I don't know what your personal life is like I don't know if you have multiple homes and what you own but your professional life is not simplistic you've got 10,000 Things my my my professional life is not simplistic but but it but it is for me meaning um like I like playing like this goes back to the relationship with losing it's not simplistic but it is let me explain what I mean by that um let me think of a good example uh something not working out for me um in business whether it's in the micro of like day-to-day vayer XL or if it's in the micro like an investment or something I put a lot of time and effort into that didn't materialize I view that like losing the first game of a pickup game Sam when I I'll tell you why it's simplistic I'm I'm not attached to my professional success or who I am I'm like in a very weird place with my winning and losing and my Gary ve of it all like I it I care so much but it's a game my professional life is a game right like like it I don't I don't I don't want to be unhappy like I fight for happiness too much and I think it is in the Simplicity you're right the day-to-day is chaotic there's meeting after meeting after meeting after meeting right um but I like it this is why I'm bringing up the pickup game I like it I like juggling 17 balls and I'm not upset about the 13 that fell on the ground and broke and more importantly I'm not worried about the people who are watching me juggle boo when the ball breaks that I think is massive yeah but when Theo Von makes fun of you it's pretty hilarious yeah but like to me that was so good did you see that video yes I did but that to me so great like that is like the ultimate like because I love Theo like like to me back to like where we came from Sam I'm like my God like I've gotten to a place where someone as epic as the o v or any other of the comedi Tim Dylan like I love these guys you know like Jerry ve I I I think like I'm I'm always fascinated when people struggle with a comedian razing like I think it's like you've that's like such flattery yeah that was awesome it was awesome I saw that I was like oh the guy I look up to he's uh he's crossed over to mainstream it's awesome um Sean what what were you gonna say well I want ask two questions one uh you showed those stock certificates on the wall speaking of winning uh I saw you invested in Twitter in 09 slack preo I think the liquid Death guy used to work with you work for you literally at vayer media the day before he started liquid death Facebook preo I'm curious what was what investment was the best investment for you what paid off in terms of you've made a bunch of bets right those the winners Facebook I haven't sold one share yet oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's insane but that goes back that goes back like insanely good yeah that that goes back to jockey over horse I tell all my friends like who get into investing I'm like man they're like what have you learned I'm like what I've learned is when I only invested in the person when I'm when I I've hit this new state where like I'm really trying to be obsessed with the person and the idea and if either one isn't like an A+ then I'm like H right you said and or or and right and but if I that's right but if I or it fully person not idea what year did you do that did you do that deal Facebook I uh 2007 oh my God so I mean I don't even know what that you'd be up 400 times I don't know I mean a lot a lot yeah 100x at least uh I want to get your rapid uh rapid take because I know you've uh one of the things we do on this pod is we kind of um we love anecdotes and also little little insights on people that we think are wired in interesting way maybe not even the way we want to be wired right like yeah we think elon's really interesting we don't think he's perfect we think there's a bunch of things he does that are cringe we think there's a bunch of things he does that are epic um there's no there's no perfect right yeah fair enough so I'm curious you've bumped into or have studied or have an opinion on any of these people so I want to go rapid fire see if you have something give us give us like either an opinion or story yeah so is this from outside observation or if I met them inside observation either one or if you have nothing you can say pass I don't have anything on them all right so so first one I want to do is Zuck you've talked about Facebook and the jockey give me Zuck dude I think he's uncomfortably underrated like he's the only person that I met back in ' 07 like in this era now I think it's getting more obvious but he understood attention he literally tried to buy Twitter he bought Instagram he bought WhatsApp he tried to buy snap he just understood attention was the only asset and and he's so nice he's he's a nice kid like like he's just a very simple nice kid I'm I'm happy with the way things are going for him a little bit right now like people can see how like doofy he is like you see him like in the corner of the UFC thing and you're like this is just a nerdy kid who like you know what I mean like and he doesn't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now people will think it's because he's got a trillion but like it it's just he's just like a dentist's son from Cadet like he's just a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nerd with no bad intent who [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] spent his childhood coding which put him in a position right he put in the hours I'm I'm a fan man I think he's a I think he's a very good operator and the reason I've never sold a shared Facebook is I've been committed for a long time in this in my own mind which was I'll never sell until he's gone Logan Paul I think Logan is really interesting so he's so do you know that Logan Paul was starting to emerge very little on vine when vayer media for Virgin mobile did a campaign called finding the next Vine star you guys kind of discovered him right like when he was I think he had like 15 or 18,000 followers it was crazy and full by the way full disclosure Jerome jar who was one of the 10 most followed people on Vine who was my partner Jerome and I launched the first influencer agency called grape story back in 13 he was the one who said you know he he let me pick from three people I think all three of them got big uh but um I think Logan is uh you know he grew up up in the Limelight right you think about like what happened in Japan or all this stuff like it's tough these kids are you think about child stars when we grew up we all knew that like child stars would be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up right and now I think like everyone's going through that the Limelight is hard so I I think Logan is well- intended uh I think he um he's very entrepreneurial like very entrepreneurial and I you know I I I've always thought of him as like a Marky Mark or or a fresh prince or the rock meaning I always watched him from afar and as I got to know him a little bit I was like okay this kid is Logan Paul today just like Marky Mark was Marky Mark before he was Mark Wahlberg just like the fresh prince of you know what Will Smith was before he was Will Smith I've always thought that Logan would cross over and he has obviously with WWE in a lot of ways and I think that will continue like if you told me Lo Logan is like an action star and is like at the like the way John Cena was at the Academy Awards last night like is Logan doing that in 15 years I'm like that makes sense to me that's how he's fired Sam you know he's only 28 he's only 28 years old the dude basically like when he was 14 or whatever like won he won in the social media game now he and then think about the pivots right both him and Jake but the thing about the pivots now he's got impulsiv he's got the podcast where he's super chill it's the opposite of crazy Divine prankster guy he pivoted to like he's the guy asking questions he's inquisitive he's curious he's got like you know the popular podcast goes WWE becomes the champion in WWE creates Prime which is going to make him a billionaire by the time he's 28 29 years old now because Prime is probably gonna be worth tens of billions if you know they did I think two billion in sales last year in this world like Prime is definitely like a two depending on the time they decide to trade it it's 2 three four five six seven billion that high I talked to I talked to Mr Beast and he was like 20 billion is where Prime is going like there's there is a basically just the just the straight to the trajectory of it that would be very very I mean that's like look I never underestimate Jimmy's foresight because he's great and I've known him a long time but just being in m&a at cpg levels my intuition is that they won't be patient enough to get to that big of a number right like like it's well the beauty is they're not operating the other guys are the guy they got a pretty killer operator yeah they're pretty young though yeah and more importantly [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I said [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] changes like everything's ha haa until it's actually in front of you it's all kicks and giggles and we're going to 20 until you fly to Atlanta and Coca-Cola actually offers you 5.9 and you got to sit there as KSI and Logan and those guys and say okay if we say yes because you know what they're gonna say you guys are like this so you're going to really understand what I'm about to say you know what they're going to say they're going to say huh we could do this right now and then in 24 months start a shampoo or a deodorant and sell it to D like so I I think it's um it'll be interesting to see how long they hold their breath and don't forget one bad year you guys know this how businesses work one bad year takes a lot of Leverage off the table in a negotiation and so you know they'll be thoughtful about that because no matter what you are once you saturate distribution and don't forget they're selling on something that's more like Supreme they're selling on cool cool right kids are buying it literally to drink it for the status simple like a fashion brand and that can only last so long Z karichi were only cool for so long [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's the point me and you reference was for all the Jersey Boys that grew up in the late ' 80s early 90s people will Google it they were the hottest jeans pants if you didn't wear your C cabar you were nothing I didn't have them by the way I was in a great life but they were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it you just compared Prime to jeno jeans uh what you going to say Sean well I asked you a bunch of names that are you know basically names that people know I'm curious who do you think is dope who are you learning from and who are you kind of admir who do you admire who do you learn from who are you inspired by because okay A lot of people are inspired by Gary Vee um who is Gary ve inspired by that's a great question I'm a little weird on this one but I'm glad I brought up uh break the web I'm like in inspired by the collective more than an individual the field yeah I love the field brother I I I just like I spend almost all of my time on the collective so I don't even have the allocation of time I also am very inspired by the following person show me the person that's currently living through massive adversity like somebody's listen I'll tell you somebody who's 10 times more inspiring to me than I think I am or deserve to be to others show me the kid that's listening right now whose father passed away from a stroke he's 16 he's got three younger siblings and his mom has to now work two jobs and he's holding it down for the fam right he's literally a sophomore in high school and he's basically the Father Figure now for three siblings he had to quit the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] football team cuz he's also like like I I I'm the son of two parents who lost a parent before they were 15 and it and back to gratitude I think I got really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up by being scared at my parents were going to die my whole childhood but it kind of converted into this gratitude framework that's insane it makes me Unstoppable you know and so yeah for me it's less Bezos or Elon or you know you know Oprah or anything it's it's much more like someone none of us know that is really in it like that that Bodega that OA owner energy that that stuff I grew up with and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with it but that person I think has it lucky back to earlier our Simplicity like owning your own little business living within your means like like that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kind of chill it could be really epic it doesn't put you on like this podcast but it's like a great life in a lot of ways and I see it a lot I lived it what building my dad's business from 22 to 34 I not that person the one that's like back to your point say the the spin of the wheel really created real adversity I'll say it again they're sophomore in high school they're they're good at school they're they're they really love football like things are going well sudden passing of their father now they've got to be the father for their three siblings their their mom is taking out an extra job like true adversity like true and they're do and Sean to finish off that sentence who who I admire and not a peep of complaining there's a very small group of kids that get that and they just convert into leader instead of woe is me or rebelling I admire that level of tenacity and grit and accountability and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it like this is I got this this is it's on me I got to put this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on my shoulders I'm gonna do this for my three siblings like I admire the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of that kid I had a I wrote down a quote uh when I was doing the research for this that I think is is exactly what you're talking about about you go forget Rags to Riches some people are just rags to rags just so that their kids have a shot at rags to riches and I respect the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of that I love that quote that was amazing thank you for finding that I really man I'm really affected by that like Sam really hit it on the head like I hate the word luck because I think that people weaponize it against people that have worked really hard but I but I believe in Serendipity and luck quite a bit because it's just the way like I was born in the Soviet Union like I got lucky to get out of there when I did if I didn't I would have come to this country in 1991 when it fell I would have been 1617 I'd sound like Ivan Drago on these podcasts I like it would have been all different and you know I just I I I I just really do admire people who I really do think entitlement and lack of accountability has become a disease in First World countries in 2024 and I just really admire people who play the other way [Music]
