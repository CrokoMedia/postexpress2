# How To Make Content That Actually Sells — Right About Now Ryan Alford

I believe marketers and businesses are going to regret the living [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of the social media free distribution era and that's why while we're still in it I'm yelling at the top of the mountains like please go get your attention look there might be another invention but I do believe that in the next 15 to 20 years we're going to be in VR heavy and when we're in VR heavy social's dead and I don't know if apple and Facebook or Amazon or Google or whoever wins VR if they're not in the mood to give you free awareness then guess what people are going to be talking about how there's this Golden Era of free awareness and we all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and didn't go hard enough you know people have regrets of like a wish in college I went to more parties cuz now I can't or like a I wish I spent more time with my dad cuz he just pass it now I can't I want this for everyone because I think it's going to go away attention is the number one asset what's up guys welcome to right about now where it's always right and it's always now joined today you know he doesn't need much of an introduction but you know I've got at least six titles for him s entrepreneur chairman of Vayner X CEO of Vayner media and five times New York Times Best Sellers and we're going to make it six Gary ve what's up brother how are you my friend I'm good you know life is good I uh cannot complain life is would listen anyway life is good when you decide it's good that's right you know we control our own destiny in a you know it's it's it's actually scary how much perspective is the punchline right like there's for every person listening there is there are millions if not hundreds of millions and probably if they're listening to this billions of people actually definitely billions of people on Earth that have it quote unquote worse than you um there's 800 of course it's billions there's 850 million people on Earth that don't have access to clean water and somebody before listening to this podcast this morning was complaining that their flight was delayed for 30 minutes yeah I you know what Gary I just thought about the pothole that I cursed out on the right over here to my office it's I drive I drive one mile to work brother you need to make a video of you filling that pothole in the middle of the night and post it on Facebook locally and I you'll become a local hero no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'll send it to city council you know they get my taxes they should uh fix this one poth hole I'll do it for them for the for the sake of the sake of the whole town Gary what the hell's new man I mean you got your hands in so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I don't even know how you keep I I have my hands in a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I watch you and I'm like God how do you keep your head straight I think for me at this point in my career I have so many right-hand men men and women right like my I'm I'm in I'm in a earned luxurious place of eating a lot of crow and putting a lot of deposits down over the last 30 years right so at 48 you know when people are like vayer sports and vriends and Vayner media and then Vayner X there's a companies under it and then the pickle ball team and then the Restaurant Group vcr and you know just like to your point there's a the winx.com everybody if you buy wine win.com sign up like that like they see it and they're like how and I'm like well AJ my brother Marcus who's been with me for 15 years runs the Sasha group kayin m Mar is my chief business officer for Vayner X she's been here 11 years Hannah's my chief of staff she's been here for 10 years Claude is HR for all of it 10 years Mark yudkin general counsel and consilier and coo for vayer x 16 years Brandon War's my best friend for the last 34 years On's the wine business Ryan harwood's my GM and partner in the pickle ball team 13 years like you know H you know you you're you're young in your journey you're a youngster as you make this is the reason people don't understand if you want to build something meaningful it's only relationships if I had people that I just hired a year or two ago in all the roles that I just mentioned by the way there's another 50 that I didn't mention that are here 7 to 15 years either running departments offices or important things Andy K runs me friends 13 years Sid runs my personal brand content a decade like Dustin you've been here now four six you know like it's you know build a culture do right by people give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about them create longevity I don't know how many people listening like football the way I do American football but if your offensive line is intact the same offensive line year after year after year watch how good your football team will be not real anymore with injuries and free agency but Jesus Christ that's how takes a village it takes a village and it and it requires you to love them not they work for you and that's where everyone gets a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up when you're a boss you work for them not they work for you and the day you figure that out is the day you start creating continuity and the day you start creating continuity you start to build the blueprint for scale yep amen I learned that the hard way man I did you know my time in Madison Avenue in New York you know in my late 20s early 30s and it was me me me me me me you know and I thought you I could carry the world on my own Tal or ability or you know whatever the hell and you get grounded real quick you cannot grow you can't do what you want without others without a hell of a team if people don't like you you're in trouble that's right and people are never going to like someone that is only in me life when you flip that M and you go we life it gets real good real fast and then as a complex thoughtful leader you start to understand some people want money some people want a title because they're insecure and they want the status some people want work life balance by the way some people and these are the people I'm always grabit to they want challenges and different things they want some people want to travel so you know some I mean I don't know like I I'm not in the business of judging what my employees want I'm in the business of trying to figure it out yep and sounds like you're doing a pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good job of it you got a lot of longevity there I saw claude's post yesterday I think it was like 10 10 years and I was like you know your Chief people officer hanging around for 10 years that that says a lot in in a real way and and you know it's the thing I'm most proud of it's also the thing I'm most disappointed about in my career I would have more people to name for you right now if I had the ability to be canderous to my employees in my 20s and 30s Gary ve the one that all of you know if you know who I am he built himself on cander it's my greatest strength I'm trying to tell the truth both in the macro and the micro right in the macro with like all my mindset stuff in the mic this is why I wrote the new book this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] did you get a chance to look at it Ry oh yeah did you read it or skim it see on the screen I did did you get a chance to read it or did you skim it or neither I don't care I'm just I'm curious I got about three4 the way through it brother great I uh so you agree with me that it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] textbook like it's detailed oh dude I it is it's the it should be in every school in every business school it's it's it's more honestly Gary as I read it I thought more like curriculum slash I was coar like it was so had charts and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I think you said that on social the other day but that's so funny I exactly what I thought I was like it is it's like a damn school book for how to own social media it's not even social media it's I feel like that yeah it's Market it's like you know go where people are yeah it's to that point so you know when I think about things I'm trying to bring value right that is that is the number one thing I'm thinking about at all times and so my cander is incredible in because if you don't give it you can't really bring value as a public figure in my private life both personal and professional but sticking on professional my inability to communicate when I Lov someone and I'm I'm a lover boy meaning like you work for me for a week and I think you're a good kid and you got something I'm like yeah we're family like I go in I'm like into team like I like I'm Uncle Gary I'm very Uncle G I'm very into that coach Gary guidance counselor Gary Big Brother Gary I love that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's my gift and at times my curse and when I say my curse it made me not be able to tell people that were bad at their job that they were bad at their job and then what would happen is I would get resentment cuz I wasn't communicating and then at some point I would fire them sloppily because I didn't give them enough feedback that is the great Scarlet Letter of my professional building culture career I feel like I've really supermanned it I think I've I think I will be revered I believe that and that's a ridiculous thing to say but I really do think when I'm old people when they look back at all the footage people realize that empathy and kindness people that words that people thought were like soft Cy stuff in business land that I looked at it as like a real thing not because I'm altruistic but because I want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] build businesses and build Empires and it requires it and I think people look back at me being a contributor to the evolution of finding that middle now the problem is when people hear me say this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sometimes they think that I'm talking about entitlement right Ry you know this right now the biggest issue for businesses mine included is you've got employees who don't want to work and get paid B go and so I just want to say it real fast when everyone hears me talking about kindness and all this nice stuff I'm not talking about like eighth place trophies I'm not talking about entitlement I'm talking about finding the middle and uh and I'm I'm passionate about that yeah well I think you've found a pretty good balance of it you know I am going to come for my check though uh I lost a million dollarars f with my passion in the car business in 2014 and uh that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] didn't work yeah I had carvana's idea before carvana I just didn't know how to operate I knew how to Market yeah I'm a marketer well you you just explained that I was actually right right that following your passion almost LED you to carvana it just sounds that you weren't good enough to pull it off I wasn't right I say this all the time like passion's always right cuz you like it more you know this you know like look I I I love marketing so I love vinner media you know I love wine collecting and trading cards and like it's easy for me to do well in things that I love if you know look I'm a Salesman I could sell anything but if you like something more you're going to do it at 10: p.m. to midnight cuz it's your hobby and if you're doing something you don't love you're not it's not complicated and so passion's a great way to go the problem is you have to be good enough yep exactly that but that's the that's the d That's the slippery slope though is hey Ry as someone who's been like you know growing especially with the podcast upu and it's great to see from AAR when you read 34s of the book so far this down me being curious what was the biggest like moment you're like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's how it's being or aha like did anything strike you yeah I'm going to give you a quote um it's because people tend to dismiss what's underpriced today instead focus on what used to work in the past past or what might work in the future the process that continue to underestimate what's working right now and that was my favorite quote from the book because it was I I feel like I'm Progressive you know I mean if you're the king of progression I mean I'm you know the second tier and so I believe it but then I start looking at the sacred cows that I have and I'm like I need to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get over that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know I've been late to the game on Tik Tock even though I I know it's big and I know that it's underpriced but I'm but you know and so I'm guilty of it but that quote alone in that scenario is it that uh how many followers do you have on Instagram 200,000 close to that so is it something where you're like you have this great number on Instagram you're like 200,000 like are you worried from a brand perception standpoint that if you go to Tik Tok and you have 83 it makes you look smaller those first couple weeks and months no I I you I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what people think the reason I asked you that is that that's a huge one for people they're in they they they Mis un they underestimate the upside for the short-term worry of brand is it because you did the cliche thing of like oh it's just teenage girls and then you just couldn't get out of that mindset at first it was and then I started posting and and you know hit off this is a couple years ago but then I became self-aware that I wasn't doing it right and I stopped and I said I'm not going to redo this until I get the team around me to do this right and now I do so we're about to go back at it fair enough I think that's that's a much better answer than most yeah but the reality is and why I circled that quote and why it stuck with me when I was reading is because I think that's what most brands and people are stuck in though is the sacred cows or the future or the future I talked to somebody the other day that fits this perfectly stuck on SEO right and infatuated with AI and no conversation of social yeah right like like tried and true I'm like tried and true for yes SEO works but doesn't work the same way it worked in 2004 no AI yes but like you don't even know what you're talking about yet and your industry is not even affected by it yet and like meanwhile all your action is on posting on LinkedIn properly and you haven't even posted on there once romantic about yesterday infatuated with tomorrow sucking at today that is the state of the union of 99% yeah and they get exactly what you the point you made you know Tik Tok can't generate leads like this Instagram doesn't do LinkedIn like that like and they get too it's all excuses like honest right it's not only all excuses I'm storry to jump in but also what you're what a lot of people don't understand is and you just broke it down I want this is why I'm jumping in I want everyone to hear this you just talked about someone who's a Salesman not a marketer yeah what most people don't know about themselves that are listening right now is their sales people not branding and marketing if you like like what you know when I was coming up the game everyone's like oh Gary doesn't get it he doesn't know how to do he's not doing funnels he's not doing they didn't get it I was playing chess they were playing checkers like they were looking for short-term Arbitrage I was playing long-term brand if you're if if you're listening right now and you say well Tik Tok doesn't get leads you're a Salesman yes which is by the way I'm a Salesman I like that but you know who sales people are people that don't know how to do brand and marketing yep they have to be left with sales and then you know what the 98% of the rest of the world is they can't do either which is why they work for salespeople or marketers that's right well everybody wants out everybody wants outcomes today damn it you know and everybody's impatient and look you know who's getting outcomes today Nike you know how they did it by building brand exactly you know who did you know who's getting outcomes today this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right here who's been doing this show for six years and Gary V is now sitting in front of me that's exactly right but that didn't happen 6 days in or 6 months in or 16 months in it's the it's the game by the way people like oh Gary I was like oh Gary nothing like I worked every day in a liquor store for 13 years to figure out how things marketed and branded like and before that I spent my childhood in in marketing and selling like um I don't know what I think Malcolm gladwell's thing was 10,000 hours [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't I got to run the math but whatever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what am I 48 whatever 42 years of trying to sell or make signs or build brand or sell whatever 40 and I didn't do school like that I gave it none of my time whatever 42 years subtracted by 7 hours of day un sleeping on average whatever that math is that's how many hours I put into this craft that's what I'm saying that that's why I've always I agreed with everything that you say but I've always respected the hell out of you because you live exactly you preach and you're do if you really watch what you're doing Gary you've always done what you're telling other people to do that's the that's the secret guys couple things on that brother one I appreciate your opening line I want people to hear this no one should agree with anyone on everything it doesn't even make sense we all have different life experiences we end up figuring out by the way we also all change our minds many people have written to me that they didn't believe something and then they believed it or vice versa that this is why I call my book day trading attention someone emailed me the other day and said hey I watch this video I've been trying it's not working I replied to him like bro I did that in 2009 that video is from 2009 shit's changed and so you know we shouldn't I appreciate that I really do I'm scared to be wrong so I talk about the the things that I know or the things that I'm living and I stay in that pocket the biggest compliment I ever get in social media is normally when someone's trying to troll me in the comments they're like Gary B you say the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I reply I'm like thank you I'm like what do you want me to make up stuff I don't believe in just to say something different yeah but that's the but what you're doing is the epitome of what you're preaching which is brand and brand you play your greatest hits over and over again and right you're literally you know cuz if you're not consistent you can't build a brand I just saw a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] billboard for Rolling Stones is going on tour these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] have been doing this ship for 80 years how do they even stay upright it's unbelievable I know I'm like when I go out with my friends like three weekends in a row but to be touring as a rock star for 50 years I don't know how the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they do it but I think it was I think it was legal drugs is I think how they pulled it off yes yes I I will say this so I'm a father of four boys and I and I had like a couple things I had to get in on top of this I was like 8 to 14 and they're into Trends but they're not into social media I don't really they're not really allowed to do it per se how do you balance that like what's the but I know being in the business like you it's good it it'd be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] great for them you know you gotta know the it starts with knowing the kid right first of all that's Epic having four boys between that age I honestly that's pretty you should just be filming that that's pure entertainment those characters must be doing all sorts of crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with each other oh dude we're we're doing everything I love it you know yeah it's awesome um as you know out of the four kids I'm sure if I said to you you have to you have to have two of the kids be on social media 12 hours a day it's now law or you'll go to jail you very quickly right now already know which two can handle it better than which two right so you know I think the way parents have to think about this stuff is first of all every parent needs to do what's right for them that being said I do think we need to be a little bit more thoughtful than just demonizing it what is social media today is Amateur hour to what they're going to be dealing with in their 20s and 30s the cell phone and social media today when they're our age is going to look like the Beeper and the CD ROM it's mundane when everyone's like oh you got to get a out of the phone like I got get mad at the phone they got to see the real world I'm like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when they're 40 they're going to live in VR 24 hours a day there is no real world you know it's an empty container like the world's going to change and so I think it's a balance but I think the answer to the question is very simple in my mind friend which is the sooner you can build actual self-esteem in the four of them versus fake self-esteem um the better they will be able to handle anything when they finally do get to 16 or 15 or 19 or whatever the rules are in your house and they're allowed to be on social and they post their first thing and people say they're ugly they're stupid they're idiots if they have actual self-esteem they'll be able to deal with it yeah that's the key and we put them in we make him do tough challenges you know like we don't shelter them and that's you know they have to they have to be on their own Merit at times and see success from it and so but no I appreciate that input so talking with Gary Vander chuk author of day trading attention coming out the 19th I believe isn't that right Gary we're like I think days away 21st 21st yep we're releasing this I think just before the episode so go buy it Amazon all the locations we'll have all those links Gary I mean it's obvious to me you know like why you wrote the book it's it's the guide book for attention marketing today now um but you know how do you implement how do you eat your own dog like what's what's your process for staying I you got the team I'm sure but staying ahead of that attention curve it's three things it's team on team and me meaning there's me and I live this this is what I do for a living there's my team of 30 40 people team Gary we're constantly flowing in a WhatsApp thread what's working what's not working the analytics the first 3 seconds of a video like it's so cool to be on this show knowing there is not a single person listening right now that should not buy this this book that's insane to me and and I'll tell you why because if somebody's listening right now and they're a principal of a high school if they're listening right now and they're a middle manager in a corporation if they have a nonprofit if they're a board member of their country club no matter who you are on earth knowing how to get people to hear you for whatever you care about raising money for a nonprofit selling T-shirts getting people to use your auto body shop buying your new tequila like whatever it's so cool that's why I'm so excited about this book I know everyone's going to get value and that's why I text booked it because everyone most people can learn in that format ironically I'm one of the few that can't anyway how do I do it it's what I do for a living it's what I do for 12 hours a day but I also like to give people context there's 50 people that work in a department in my company called the pack Department Platforms in culture all they do for a living is pay attention to what the platforms are doing and how they algorithms are working and what the best way to get 50,000 views instead of four views the best way to get a million views instead of 100,000 views on every platform Snapchat Spotlight LinkedIn I'm one of the few humans on Earth that have over a million followers on all of the platforms Pinterest LinkedIn Snapchat YouTube Facebook Instagram Tik Tok like Twitter like like um I believe in all of these platforms have way more attention than people think way more and I believe that being the best at it matters and so how do I eat my own dog food I like here's how I'm going to show it to you I know this is probably audio for most people but like for example literally this morning 8:34 this morning right I wrote The Copy personally for my post on Instagram M I'm in it right I I'm in the gym I'm in the gym I'm the one I'm not there's no steroids here there's no OIC there's no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] taking a young person's blood and transfusing it into me oh come on you had a vampire facial last night I know you did I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in it you know I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in it and I want to be the best in the world at it and then I'm very lucky I also well lucky I built a 2000 person Global agency it's one of the biggest best social media and overall marketing agencies in the world so I have data my company spends billions of dollars Ryan on media on social media and media billions do you know much information I'm seeing and for everything chicken wings and and and sodas and hoodies and Airlines and all of it so you know I'm in a very unique position of seeing a lot more than the person you see in your feed that's giving you like an Instagram hack that's looking like a profession and I like those characters I think they're doing a lot of them are doing decent jobs but mine is so Omni I'm sitting with information that is like incredibly rare there are there are no there are zero humans on Earth that have a 2,000 person Global agency Global Latin America APAC Europe and they themselves are one of the most established content creator Personalities in the world I am that person and I'm very humbled by that actually and I'm so humbled by it and I was so parented well that and I'm such a weird character do you know what my team feels about this book the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my agency's mad at me for giving it away yeah they're like what are you doing and I'm like guys this doesn't the information can't sit with us it doesn't sit that long it's day trading attention it's going to change but I'm going to give everybody the principles and I'm going to tell them there's not one person that doesn't follow this that won't get results similar to best practices in health and wellness I promise everyone who's listening if you cut down your carbs and sugar and you go to the gym and actually start doing you know strength work your body and your physicality will be better two years later I lived it you've seen my videos 10 years ago I've lived it yeah yeah and I've got the emails from Brandon from uh Wine Library from 2009 I was going through all my like I did that Gary ve search through like I like how long have I like known Gary ve like I look I got Brandon's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] email sending me a wine list from 2009 I think so when you brought his name up I was like I totally know yes yes day trading attention with Gary ve so you brought up to 2,000 people I I asked I asked my community I was like all right what do you want what do you want to know from Gary repeat question it was all about AI right go figure so what industry including your own because you got to think about it you employ 2,000 people and marketing and advertising will be impacted has been impacted so what are the industries that you know are going to be most impacted and how do you reflect on it as it relates to like your company uh advertising is going to be one of the top yep like we're right at the Forefront of this we're the bookstores we're the taxi cabs like if you're an adobe designer if you for a living design images on Adobe for an agency you better wake the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up like you've got a few minutes here because we've got to figure out copyright and trademark law companies are going to be the big companies that use agencies are going to tread lightly but I mean this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is coming brother it's really coming so I think a lot about it this is why we spend so much time on strategy and thinking and not just being someone who makes something I tell my team all the time we get we get paid for our brains then what we make but I mean to answer your question everything if think about the last 20 years everyone who's so proud that they told their kids to become coders and developers and they've gone on to make good money and now you can already see the early stages of like wait a minute in 5 years am I going to be able to build an entire website by talking it out and then an AI will just write the code like it's I mean brother uh I'm even worried about the only thing I've always thought I had which was my brain I believe that you can map everything that I've ever said and that eventually the machine learning and the technology will get so good that I believe at some point everybody on Earth can think the way I think can literally get answers to how I'm critically like what is Gary ve thinking about this let's say a new thing came out scha it's the hot new app what is Gary What would V think about scha enter and that because of everything I've ever said and the Machine learning and all the work that the answer would actually be the answer exactly that's if you aren't thinking about that if you don't if you haven't made that connection you're fooling yourself like if you haven't thought that deep down this rabbit hole it's why I've always said this the the ultimate is brand cuz it's the only thing that's left after everything gets commoditized which allows you to Pivot to whatever is left Gary be's carrots organically grown good for your health buy now toilet bowl whatever I mean I thought about you know like blue collar stuff yeah I mean like to me it's like you know for me as long as I believe in it when I did empathy wines I believed in it I believe that with be friends I'm building the next Pokemon meet Sesame Street with this book when people buy this for 28 bucks or whatever it is on Amazon I'm like oh my God like they're like how do they not get $28 in value with in the first second they're going to do one they're going to change everybody's going to change the way they make every piece of content the first piece of content instead of normally getting 800 views is going to get 8,000 and those 7200 impressions are worth more than 28 bucks like that's a great feeling that's people are like hey G I'm scared of selling I'm like that's cuz you don't believe in what you're selling I'm scared of selling too if I don't believe in it one of the reasons I'm so weird and say different things than a lot of people is I don't know what to do if I don't even know how to sell something I don't think is right what do you do yeah well authenticity you know that proves that you are authentic doesn't it I I think so I think I I I think it really matters like I really don't understand if you this is what my argument is with a lot of people in Madison Avenue and you were there Ry yep they sell [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they don't believe in do you really think if you're sitting right now at Omnicom and selling banner ads on the web that you as a human think that's a good idea like like if you're selling like like do you really think the best deal in marketing is a billboard outside like do those people really think that hell no they know they know I think they know they know let me ask I do have this question and then I'm going to talk about a couple Pages a couple these charts and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] um uh how Okay brand outcomes attention how do we we we you know I have friends that go well you can you know take your shirt off and run around and get attention all day what is that attention how do you turn intention into intent how do you turn buzz into bite um having a good product or service that people want at asking this is the followup to jab jab jab right hook this book was originally called jab jab jab left hook instead of day trading attention to your buddy's points like if people going to look at you because you look being attractive is a really interesting concept to me right so like I think about why people would stop in the feed right there's and and really why would somebody sit there's humor I think we can all agree that humor is like a great place right there's attractiveness I don't think this is going to confuse anymore we tend to stop in our feed if we think someone looks good right there's and there's what I think I've lived on which is like value of information and I think of those things in macro and micro there's some people that are very good at perspective and mindset and blueprint and then there's people that will go very tactical I've played both in a lot of ways um so what when your buddies go well easy for you ride to get attention I'm like look if Ry is selling if he's got his shirt off and they stop but he's selling like B2B SAS products and none of those people convert then what did we achieve and that's true but if people stopped and this is why I think people don't mix their content enough if someone stops and you're look at all Diesel and they're like look at those [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pecs and then they click your account and the prior post is you talking in detail about a B2B set I mean just think about how Wild this concept is a B2B SAS product for Enterprise corporate if three of the thousand people that stop to look at either they want to look like you or they're attracted to you and then click that other one and be like what is this if three of those thousand are actually in that industry one of those three may lead to a lead so so I think where people get hurt is they do content for the sake of getting attention but never have the other part of it and then they don't do the other part of it CU their grid doesn't look good or it's not on brand they don't get it they're in the business of the Academia of marketing or the insecurity of marketing the reason most people don't put out content that will help them sell more stuff is they know it won't do as well so they keep putting out photos of their abs or their ass right because they want a th likes or they want a million likes yeah they want that dopamine hit yeah exactly it's all just High School it is I'm on page 72 literally a chart amplification spending against what works AKA not wasting a penny teaching you how to literally make sure you double down on what you need to double down and what you're learning it's kind of a learn cycle in a way it's like okay what are we learning and how do we double down on it I'm simplifying yep it's it's the organ I'll make it very common sense for everyone I think you've been paying attention everyone who's listening social media changed 3 years ago it's now about the individual pieces of content the tiktock ification of social it's not like when I grew up in Social where you try to get as many followers as possible and then a certain percentage of those followers see the content Ryan's got 200,000 on Instagram I have 10 million both of us can post right now today and he can get twice as many views on a video than I can if his video hits right versus is me putting out something that really does not hit right that is insane once you know that that content hit right the algorithm has mitigated the biggest risk in marketing which is the creative once you mitigate the Cris the risk of creative you you can then decide if you want to amplify it more importantly or equally as important you can also extract insights from it why did it do well that's like what I spend all my time on Ry I'm obsessed with why why why why the most successful people are the Curious people like that's what it is you got to know why you you're your body your mind your soul your being won't let you not ask that question yeah and especially towards the human that was always what I like that's what I got it that's who I became like I was just always curious like why even when I didn't know that bullying was based on kids that were unhappy at home even in third grade I was like I felt bad for the bully I'm like something's wrong and I was scared of the bully like everybody else and the bully back then in the 80s and jersey in third and fifth grade they were big kids The Williams Brothers they were big kids I was scared of them but I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] knew in my heart I'm like nah they're not beating the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of all of us for just kicks and Giggles there's something wrong why why people are mad at their boss for being mean to them even though the boss has always been decentish and now they're like ah my boss is a dick now or I hate him I got to get out of here [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] him and they don't realize the why is well a month ago he found out that his spouse has terminal cancer and he hasn't told you yet so why don't we give people the benefit of the doubt in the story that I just told why would you if someone's been good to you for 5 years or solid or at least neutral that at the first turn that they were not as good as normal and they R like it wasn't good why do you immediately go into I hate that person I'm done I'll tell you why cuz you yourself are insecure you're not in a good enough place to have the compassion to be like wait a minute Johnny's been decent now he's like really riding me this week in a night nice way people are selfish they go into what they're feeling to me that logically is like something's wrong with Johnny empathy I'm very bullish on it and I and that same ability in human interaction helps you be a good salesman and marketer the reason I put out good content is I have a good feel of what the world is looking for right now that I feel that I can contribute to there's a lot of things I know that would do well but I don't think I can contribute to it I don't know it as well it doesn't come natural to me you know I'd love to speak a lot more here's one let me give you it in detail you like this dust you haven't heard this from me I would love to talk a lot more about grieving I think it's a big subject matter yeah I just have been fortunate and unfortunate that I can't speak to it here's why fortunate because I'm 48 years old that my mom's mom my grandma who I really knew my great uncle Misha who's a father figure to me that's where I'm at my great-grandmother but I was little like unfortunate because so many of my family members died before I was even born both my grandfathers one of my grandmothers so you know I have a small family Holocaust stuff like that so you know I um I I can't speak to it brother I have thoughts on it but I just don't feel comfortable you know I can observe from afar but back to what we were saying earlier I like to talk about stuff I've lived you know but one day I will one day unfortunately I will and I have a funny feeling in 30 years I'll have content on it because I think it's a big one out there yep it is I mean it social media has made us more connected than ever but yet disconnected for from some real discussions well that's because we're incredibly emotionally vulnerable as a society we the last 35 years of parenting specifically has been incredibly bad at getting people to be comfortable with discomfort I mean eighth place bro I hope your 14 to8 your 8 to 14 year olds don't have eth play Str you I hope you melt I hope you throw that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the garbage dude you you're singing from The Playbook man I as soon as they came home with the the you know the uh Medallion that thing went in the uh like bottom of the trash can like not didn't do it in front of them but like that's not hang that's not hanging out you know there's a really positive way to throw it in the trash can like it doesn't have to be like cliche like oh Alpha [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Dad no no like really talk about it talk about the reason their kids are more grown up than people think you sit down 11-year-old and be like listen it's not that I don't want you to have this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] six Place trophy or medal it's that you have to understand losing is good you guys came in sixth you guys lost that's good you shouldn't be rewarded for that in the game of a basketball tournament like there's a positive way to talk about it anyway I think I think we have a lot the reason we're lonely is we're we're scared we're scared of people's opinions we're scared of losing in front of others keeping up with the Joneses blue check marks followers money status how attractive is your boyfriend girlfriend wife husband how much money do they make all these vain [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'll say this that's why you need to focus on what's real what you can do that actually impacts what you're doing that's what this is about like that we get to too caught up in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's excuses and you know this we all know this you get caught up in it you don't know it but once you really reflect you know it's excuses because you're focused on things that you don't have control over you know well that's what that's what they're trying to do to us right like that's what the news is that's what Society is that's what politicians that's what parents like that's what schools do like it's you don't control [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in like most of your life this is why I love you know it's so funny after my last rant like none of that matters meanwhile I'm trying to build an Empire I'm not demonizing success or winning that's all I'm trying to do I'm just trying to get people to be healthy about it so once they get there they can stay there bro I'm sure even at you know I'm sure at this point in your life you've seen in front of your eyes circles or close circles people get real paper and real money and then 3 four years later it's all gone 100% and some a lot of times in that story the family's gone the reputation's gone it's not a good life they got to success in the wrong way and it's CU it wasn't success it was fake success it was proxy success exactly but that's why we got to be day trading attention we don't want proxy success we need all success I'm telling you right now it is crazy I can't believe I'll leave it with this for all of you I can't believe none of you most of you the majority of you are not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] taking this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] more serious social media is free Ryan it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] free brother it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] free they don't charge you when you post do you know what a newspaper ad costs a lot do you know what a billboard costs a lot do you know what Direct Mail costs a lot television commercial a lot sponsorship of an event a lot Google AdWords a lot pre-roll YouTube a lot Hulu interstital ads a lot influencers to plug your product a lot like I don't the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people are doing organic social media is the most important thing in the world figure it the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out stop crying stop bullshitting this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it Bingo free free I almost called this I almost called this book it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] free double f [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] free and you got the guide book to do it day training attention all of it there Gary a question what's your own versus rented land do you leverage do you leverage the free to get them to the owned you know the website list yeah yeah of course by the way I think I talk about I know I talk about in the book please have your default URL proper on your social hell yeah of course attention is always being sent to the owned right yes when you you know like I don't know I'm on this right now getting attention and if it's and if people like what I'm saying they're going to buy a $20 book that's yours right in this scenario I'm obviously sharing that with Amazon and my publisher but at least my publisher had to pay me a big bag to be a partner in it but yeah brother of course because you built brand over time and you had leverage to do that correct and of course like you want your podcast linked up there or something else like and I change my links depending on what I want people to know about and so of course you're sending them to other places but you're extracting everyone's like the algorithms are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me I'm like no no you should be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] them it's free extract the attention from it that's why they're so powerful everyone cries about social but it's their most important thing cuz the attention's there yeah that's what look what is it 6 hours a day for what 18 to 24y old on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Tik Tok forget about 18 to 24 year olds all of us older [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are on it all day the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are 40-year-olds doing everyone's on it all day if I'm not work like what do you all day most people most people watch television with social as the companion definitely Twitter definitely in sports and politics your phone is the TV and your TV is the radio that's what I've been saying that's right that's right Gary I know people know where to find you but I want to be respectful of your time we' come up to it here uh always again respect the hell out of your directness how you I don't know man it's always been relatable again no matter what you think or what you see you've lived it you've done it and I you know I led the witness a little bit with how you're eating your dog food because I wanted them to hear that Gary isn't writing this book He's just giving you the road map of what he's already [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] doing every day and and he's living it I just I want this for everyone because I think it's going to go away my belief is the look there might be another invention but I do believe that in the next 15 to 20 years we're going to be in VR heavy and when we're in VR heavy social's dead and I don't know if apple and Facebook or Amazon or Google or whoever wins VR if they're not in the mood to give you free going to be talking about how their Golden Era of free awareness and we all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and didn't go hard enough you know people have regrets of like a wish in college I went to more parties cuz now I can't or like a I wish I spent more time with my dad cuz he just passed and now I can't like I believe marketers and businesses are going to regret the living [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of the social media free distribution era and that's why while we're still in it I'm yelling at the top of the mountains like please go get your attention so that you can then pivot and do what whatever you need to do when the tide turns and that's the biggest that's the takeaway that's the big aha right it's like yeah it's about you need to sell more today of course you do but you need leverage over time that's right you get to take your brand to the next platform whatever it is I mean I did it I I I I just did that my original platforms Wine Library TV on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] YouTube that's right and on and on vidler on viddler and on Ustream for live and mircat I got attention in and Vine I got attention in and social cam I got attention in and photo booth I got attention in and Myspace I got attention in and you know it just e and flows let's grab dinner in New
