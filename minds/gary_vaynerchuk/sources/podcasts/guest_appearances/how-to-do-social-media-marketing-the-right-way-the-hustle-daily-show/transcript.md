# How To Do Social Media Marketing The Right Way — The Hustle Daily Show

I don't need to be a genius to know that the last decade every day looking at the top of the charts has given me an incredible indication of what's going on out there there's a direct correlation of what's going on in Ai and this app being number one makes sense the one that stands out right away is number five threads threads is declining from that hype but here it is up there but then you keep going shine and teu lowc cost shopping okay e-commerce number 10 wow cap cut being number 10 speaks directly to why I wrote day trading attention there is Art and Science to being great at so to really Crush that's interesting attention is the number one asset all right hey Gary how's it going welcome to the show thanks for having me yeah of course it's a pleasure to have you here and you know we got you here for many different reasons but obviously the one big reason today is to talk about your new book I actually have a copy right here with me um wanted to talk to you a bit about this book uh because it comes out May 21st and you know you've written a lot of books in your time and compared to other works like crushing it and the other works that you've put out what's so different about this one and what did you kind of aim to give your audience this time around well it's actually kind of interesting cuz it's you know crushing it was the follow-up to crush it and I would say day trading attention is the followup to jab jab jab right hook 10 years ago I wrote a book that really hit one of the definite reasons I wrote this book was how many people were emailing me about jab jab jab right hook in the last year or two when that book was written in 20 2014 of best practices of social media creative that was intended to really be a book that was good for 2014 and 15 and I was like wait a minute people are emailing me and saying this is so great and it's helped them grow when I know 83% of that book is obsolete or not as great as they could be doing it and originally day trading attention was called jab jab jab left hook and so it's different than some of my books but it's very similar to one I've written in the past and then specifically now because I really do think marketing has finally tilted to we're on the other side of the Hill no longer are we debating is social an important part of the mix part of the mix I I think you've got to be pretty out of touch delusional or corporate political um to be fighting for alternative platforms as your predominant bet on building a brand and driving sales you know obviously Google AdWords is intent-based selling right people search something they buy it fine but I'm talking about brand building for the sake of brand building or sales both for personal brand nonprofit uh political aspirations and definitely selling stuff as an entrepreneur or a Fortune 50 company and I would say the fortune 5000 set is incredibly bad at Social Media Marketing uh and and I don't say incredibly bad lightly and I'll be honest with you I actually think I'm being kind I think there's a huge disconnect there's not ways to measure it there's a misunderstanding it's incredibly corporate when it needs to be authentic and so big opportunity to write the book and really I wanted to make it I don't John I don't know if you uh did you have a chance to read it or skim it or yes absolutely read or skim read read so actually just to like flip the turntables for fun you know what was the biggest aha or biggest observation you had I haven't been able to talk to a lot of people that have read it yet so I'm pretty excited right now what was the what was the take what was the o or like what was the best part or the most surprising part I got to say one of the things that really did surprise me in your take on everything and it's something that completely kind of goes against the grain of everything in advertising as far as big brands are concerned is kind of the abandonment of brand guidelines I thought that was a really fantastic realization because every time you know i' I've worked in ad agencies before and every time you're in there they want to be very very specific about we have to use these colors we have to use these specific fonts we have to cater to exactly what our brand is like in a commercial but it seems like you kind of went against the grain there and said you know what you have to blend in to this platform like Tik Tok or Instagram you can't be a sore thumb and if you're kind of a brand coming in there with your preconceived notions about what your content should be then it's not going to work out for you so I thought that was a really fun realization yeah I think that context matters I think relevance at scale to as many consumer segmentations is incredibly more important to actually driving business than delusional subjective opinions in a boardroom of what you know fonts and colors to your point I have all sorts of feelings about that but I can somewhat get on board occasion if I'm tired um but man someone's opinion of an adjective or like a picture the big issue that brands have to your point is they are pushing corporate down historical Academia of marketing ideology most of the principles that Marketing in agencies and Fortune 500 land are living on is based on books and Academia that foundational to the 80s and early 90s prec consumer internet and so yeah I mean just so everybody knows it's the the way you phrased it blending in to me it's like look if you are not relevant to a if if you go to a cocktail party and you were not relevant in your words and your dress and your demeanor and your energy and your charisma to the 27 to 32y old Hispanic males in that corner and you come over and you bomb and they're not interested said it's unlikely that you'll be able to get them to be your friends or do things with them same for a brand if your brand shows up with its textbook brand positioning guidelines and you post something on Tik Tok and let me say this slow that's trying to make a 35 to 40y old young mom buy your product we're not talking about the kids now this is not just gen Z the stunning amount of 35 to 45-year-old female that consume Tik Tok all day long if you're trying to give them a commercial let's go back to what we do here that makes them buy your beauty product or your apparel or your HomeGoods and it is not contextual to Tik Tock and it is not relevant to them because in this scenario you're making an ad for you know Korean born immigrant moms that are into yoga on in the Pacific Northwest it will not sell and I watch every day Fortune 5000 companies and I say 5,000 because it's not just Fortune 500 when you go into 5,000 you go into late stage Venture Capital you go into private Equity owned Brands I watch them continuously miss the mark by bringing television process operations and mentality to a social media real world and and it is why we are seeing so much disruption and change and the shame with that is you mentioned it in your book that it seems like nowadays for Brands the opportunity is endless out there because they can put out any content any time of the day they could test things out they can take those stats apply them to whatever commercials they want to do more targeted things in the future as you mentioned but is now kind of the best time for Brands if they want to get on top of this trend because as you talked about it too you have this part of social media now ever since Tik Tok you call it tiktock ification where you serve Things based on what you like and not people you like or people you follow so has that completely changed the game and can Brands now do whatever they want in in a way in a way that's b b bananas like the Merit and the do you understand that I've been grinding every day for 15 years to build up this audience of mine that I treated like email marketing meaning I would try to put out an a piece of content that brought them value but I knew that I put in all this work and I had 15 million followers and a percentage of them would see it just like email and email open rates now you brother can post a video today around pingpong around this blog or this podcast or this whatever and if the content is right of the moment culturally and uses best practices on platform and the book I talk about as pack platforms and culture the fact that you can get more views than anything I've ever made in my career that is a level of creative meritocracy and consumer insights to why it happened that fortune 5 countries dream about and spend millions of dollars on and I I I can't believe that they continue to disrespect this as content these are ads social media ads this is a new thing at Vanner media we've banned content it is social media ads and and even the word test do you know that we've also banned test and you're not wrong about the way you said it but when you say hey Brand you can test and learn up until and they just think it's a proxy to the commercial to me this is advertising for the sake of better advertising John let me let me say this I start the book with the Ocean Spray example that it all sold out Across America because of one Tik Tok more recently Walgreens has a private label called nice you probably bought their nuts like everybody else at the register at ttimes right and I've bought like their water for $5 for 24 before oh yeah there you go you bet they have a private label named nice and one of the things they make amongst peanuts and and water is mango gummy candies that's right so this is on your radar yep yeah we've reported on it actually a few weeks ago I love you cuz you that means you are doing God's work to changing this industry a single post as you know of mango gummy nice private label mango candy went out caught fire and every bag at Walgreens Across America sold out so much so that if everybody who's listening right now goes to eBay opens up the app or their laptop and goes to eBay and types in nice mango gummies enter and then if they know how to use eBay go to completed items and click you will see that many people have bought them for a massive Arbitrage on the flip because the demand was that significant a single ad not even done by an agency or a brand sold out this product Across America in record time had enormous economic impact and there is not a single example of a television commercial achieving that in the last 5 years yeah and that's incredibly impressive it really speaks to the power of social media the Power of the internet as well to kind of carry things get Trends going and you know G Gary you mentioned something earlier about you spending 15 years grinding you're still grinding I know you are uh but there was a time period at the beginning of your career where you were grinding for seven plus years about and that was alone uh by yourself doing work uh kind of putting it out and producing your own stuff um what was that grind like for seven plus years cuz a lot of creators now are One-Stop shops and this was even much before then uh so can you talk a little about that early day it was enjoyable right I was trying to build an internet business and a retail business from my dad's store to your point I literally made the signs when I say I made the signs I literally like an hour of my day every day in my 20s was going around the store making new displays of things I wanted to sell and then taking out like an 8x10 piece of hard paper and taking a marker and making signs and putting it up and watching consumer behavior and trying to learn how to write emails that made people buy things back in 97 98 99 2000 buying my own Google AdWords managing operating early on in my Creator career from 2006 to 2013 all of my content I did myself I filmed it you know I put it up like I wrote Every tweet you know honestly it's the days that I most miss you know it's fun I love the journey I you know I'm in a weird point in my career where now people know me and you know that's different that's a new phenomenon for me and I'll never do a new business or new Venture where it'll be in the dark and I missed the dark I missed nobody paying attention to my mad scientist ways and clocking in and clocking out and putting in the work and learning and making mistakes and adjusting and really honing my humility and and confidence and balancing those two too and consumers and listening listening listening for the opportunity to talk you know so much of my so much of my career is based on what I say most people don't realize most of my day is listening reading my DMs watching what's happening what's trending seeing mango gummies go viral before it's written about or covered on a great show like this I I I pride myself on having my P pulse to the beginning of things and are micro moments viral moments actually previews of macro consumer Trends going to say that really slow one more time because I think this could be the one sentence that brings value to senior marketers that are listening can a microv viral moment be the beginning of a macro consumer Trend these are things I really care about and so back you know what was it like it was the it was the best especially because I was building it for my father right I was very obsessed probably unhealthy obsessed in giving back to my parents bringing us from the Soviet Union to America I put my parents on a pedestal they're my best friends I love them the most and I knew I was a talented kid with business cuz I proven that to myself with baseball cards and early times that I worked in the liquor store from 14 to 20 and so the early days were awesome in building the business and the early days of being a content creator were awesome because I was learning the craft I think something that makes Vayner media my agency so unique is I'm the chairman CEO but I am an active executor of our services and I'm easily and this is with all due respect I apologize to all 2,000 employees that work for me when they hear this but I'm easily the most proficient and skilled at the craft as well within the organization that is unheard of brother in advertising every CEO that I compete with is sitting in an ivory Tower of a corporation predominantly in Europe that couldn't post on a social network or know how to run a media play or know what you know live ramp is or data lakes or dmps or for forget about what I wrote about in this book the first three seconds of a video and the creative variable and the copy and the time you post the science around the art I mean this is this is um this is my craft yeah and you know you do really immerse yourself in your craft you talked about listening and that's something you also mentioned in the book a lot is that people have asked you for example you know everybody knows you're an early investor in Tumblr and Facebook and Twitter um so I imagine a lot of people ask you to predict what they should invest in what they should be doing next but in reality uh you say what they should be doing is listening so how how do you listen and how do you prescribe people to listen nowadays in Social just spend time on the platforms or is it more than that it's a little bit more than that but not much brother to your point the point that you were making earlier for everyone who's listening everyone's like man you saw round corners I'm like no I was just walking you know on the actual Street you know like and then I would turn on the corner and I'm like oh there it is the trash can or the alley cat or a painting um you know like and so I I'm a practitioner and I think that's a huge factor in marketing I think the industry is filled with pontificators and corporate animals I'm a practitioner and so when I say listen like I'll give you an example I'll do it right here on the spot I'm going to my phone I'm opening an app I'm going to the app store I'm going to search right this is all happening in real time I didn't get a chance to do it this morning usually I I try to do it but I didn't so this will be fun I'm scrolling top fre apps number one chat GPT okay I don't need to be a genius to know that the last decade every day looking at the top of the charts has given me an out there chat GPT I would like to think most people know what that is that are listening as you can imagine there's a direct correlation of what's going on in Ai and this app being number one makes sense to me right sense the one that stands out right away is number five five threads on Instagram I'm feeling threads is declining obviously from that hype but here it is up there I'm like o was there an update today is there something going I have to look a little bit deeper right but then you keep going right the fact that shine and Teemu right lowcost shopping so shopping okay e-commerce cap cut number 10 wow editing soft like literally cap cut being number 10 speaks directly to why I wrote jab jab jab excuse me I almost did that's funny why I wrote day trading attention it's we are in the moment now where people are realizing there is Art and Science to being great at Social to really Crush that's interesting right I keep going but what I'm really looking for just so everyone knows is I'm going to scroll a little bit lower I'm actually going to go to 150 just to see real quick for the phone or actually I'm going to go down even further um at 200 so I'm at 200 and I'm going up now right and banned app for all groups 197 and this is to keep all your groups organized I'm like oh this looks like group Channel what's this so this is something that I now like is on my radar now if for a month I see band go from 197 to 44 well it's time to download and really play and that's why I saw musically so early on and that's why I saw Snapchat so early on and so you're really looking at these things to understand what's popping I also see Domino's and Alexa and I see you know Wing Stop 190 there's a direct correlation to this data of what's going on right WNBA 172 I don't think anyone's going to be confused here the WNBA is hotter today than it was 24 months ago crumble the cookie app at 170 kudos to them that's like interesting and so what you're seeing is I'm kind of giving you kind of how my brain works I'm like paying attention to what is happening that's one of the places I may go trending topics there 's an app called Break the web that I've been using lately that just kind of Aggregates the news almost like trending topics that we would look at for Twitter and X was very big for me for a long time this is doing it for the whole web right I see Bridgerton recap you know I see Supreme Court I see Blake Lively I click on Blake Lively um stars in a new movie now I know right now I didn't know this a second ago that Blake Lively and Colleen Hoover like this is very fun to say for everyone to listen the reason I tend to know a lot of stuff about emerging consumer segmentations and consumer Trends is because I spend the time putting in the work to try to know AKA for a lot of people that are listening in adland I am a strategist but I'm not a strategist that like goes to redit and like takes my like I'm all over the place I'm absolutely everywhere as many places I can and whether that's Reddit or Instagram or Tik Tok and I'm staying curious I'm looking at the podcast top 100 200 I'm looking at the apps top 100 200 I'm I'm reading people's comments I'm just kind of in it yeah and that's a great place to be it's important to keep your finger on the pulse and I think for you know as you mentioned as a CEO and founder of a company to just be that on top of it that's very unique and I feel like that's why my my big thing here brother is why wouldn't you be it's the customer like people like Gary I don't have time for this I'm like what are you spending your time on if you're not spending your time on trying to understand what humans care about if I'm putting on my professional hat so that you can then have an opportunity to make it relevant to them what are you spending your time on what are you paying attention to what's going on in the world so you can be a better parent a better sibling a better even little silly stuff a better dinner date like what are you doing yeah right be informed you should be informed and you know uh something that you did mention in your book is after getting informed right after knowing who you're trying to reach what you're going to do now talk to me about actually producing the content so um there's a lot of social media platforms out there everybody knows you know you got your YouTube you got your Tik Tok you got your X you got your uh Instagram and it's mainly told I feel like everybody should be diversifying the kind of content they put on each platform but not everybody does that because they don't feel like it or maybe they produce this one content and you know you might as well just put it everywhere and see what sticks uh what is your advice for kind of diversifying each piece of content for each platform I think you can take the same video and post it everywhere but I highly recommend that if you're posting on LinkedIn and you're posting on Tik Tok let's think about those two places and you're posting the same video at bare minimum and I do this a lot cuz this would be my bare minimum move in this scenario at bare minimum please change the copy completely to support the platform good news copy writers your copy is required in these environments like you really need to figure out where and what the audience is thinking about and and and that's how I would attack it like now my preference is that you would change the thumbnail the first 3 seconds the hook you know along with the copy and I think as you get more advanced and you allocate more dollars to it you should um but that's how I think about platform strategy like and how to get more content out into the world more platforms more platforms more platforms and then more more different pieces of creative the big the big issue right now for a lot of people listening is on brand or tone of voice means they want their grid to aesthetically look the same so not only do you need platform strategy but you need within platform strategy hence how I structured the book and I think that um I think people really misunderstand the concept of relevance at scale to different consumer segmentations which is going to make your grid look a little messy but that's good because it means you're actually creating relevance with more consumers yeah and you know you've also talked about today even in the past like 20 minutes you talked about how important that first three seconds is that hook to kind of get people to watch your content why is it important why is it valuable to them I think value is something that you really like to hit on which is super important um can you give me how you construct a hook or how you would construct a hook in that first 3 seconds um Simplicity punch uh to you you you obviously are leading the witness cuz you're educated I do think value matters like what am I going to get out of this right that's how I think about when I tell you there isn't a single time I do creative where I'm not like what's this person going to get why should they consume this this is what I Raz a lot of my contemporaries who've done very well in life I'm like what are you what value do you think you posting yourself on a private plane does for your audience I'm like I know what value it's doing for you you're closing the gaps of insecurity I'm like but explain to me why this is good for them and once in a while Through The Years somebody would counter me with like it's aspirational I'm like I'm like look if I'm being overly kind you can probably manipulate me into believing that but it's not why you posted it and so I'm I think a most of my career is been built on I've been obsessed to why so when I think about the hook it's like why you know like and it's very of the moment like here's an example if you're in the home selling business on any side of the funnel are high interest rates right now keeping you from being able to sell and buy a new home like that like is pretty much explaining to that person like why right like my world that I love with wine by the way everyone should sign up for winx.com winex text my dad would be very happy but like the reason I just did that little funny plug though seriously though you should buy from wi Tex it's that good um is because I've been doing these I'm I'm helping my dad's store that's like a new service we have it's like Groupon you get a deal of the day on text you just reply with how many bottles it's killing it and we're crushing my thesis but like you know that first 3 seconds need to be like are you drinking the same Rosé over and over and want to get a much better one for half the price that's not very hard for so like you know I don't know how your drinking patterns are but if you're into Ros and we're think about when I just did that we're go we're right on the precius of Rosé season right so I culturally know what's going on I know what's going on with the consumer and then you could see I can make that hook right and so you know for for for day trading attention it's like such easy content right it's like have you stagnated your growth on Instagram well the answer is almost everyone has because of why I'm writing this book it's hard it's supply and demand of attention there's too much Supply right now to get easy views and so you have to be better that hook for the opening line as you can imagine I'm going to be able to get a lot of people to stop with that cuz it matters to them yeah cuz you're meeting them where they are right you're meeting the consumer where they are you're addressing their concerns I think is the important part I'm I'm meeting and let me break down meeting where I am because I think this will help a lot of people I'm meeting them in distribution and need state I'm meeting them where they are because people actually consume their gr their feed in Social and um to your point which I think is what you making I'm meeting them on their need state right now mhm exactly exactly which is the most important thing right for the consumer and you know you talk about um at least one part of your book you kind of talked about quality versus quantity and everybody's kind of always having that argument these days with social right cuz you should put out more content more content more content and that sometimes will sacrifice the quality and it seems like your idea is to do both right put out more content that is better um at any point do you think creators can be oversaturating markets putting content let me help creators right now almost everyone doesn't know who you are powerful silence after that I wanted that to really settle in for everyone when I when creators come in here who have like 51,000 followers and they're like Gary you know I don't want to be Overexposed I'm like brother good news no one knows who the hell you are bro I I go to airports I get stopped 13 times for selfies it's profoundly a lot it's a lot but it's 13 4,000 people walk by me do you know what I mean you make a good point you make a good point so overexposure no uh but it's a quality quantity ratio to your point does everybody have enough creative ideas to put out good content like these are the things that are the issue right like I think that that's a huge issue that most people aren't creative enough for new ideas different formats um do they have enough finan for brands that are listening have they allocated enough money towards it Brands will hire a creative a agency millions of dollars to think of one idea for the year but they don't get they don't spend that much money on producing social media creative it's nuts it's crazy so you know I think there's a lot to this yeah and in terms of coming up with creative uh obviously a lot of people tend to go on the platform you know even in your book you mentioned search kind of what your industry is right if you're a car dealership you had a passage about car dealerships right if you own a car dealership search car dealership and you'll find some content that you like um and that you can potentially replicate or put your own spin on so the idea with creating new types of content though has been interesting to me um is it all right as well to try completely different formats that maybe haven't succeeded on the platforms yet or would you mainly put Mo most of your energy to try to kind of mimic other things that have already been successful but make them your own yes both so both that's right corporate and entrepreneurs and creators alike love or everybody loves or brother people love or and meanwhile over here the brilliant One the good brother of the two brothers cuz or's the bad brother is and and sitting over here being like yo I'm here I can solve all your problems like it's unbelievable right now I'm going to do a really interesting exercise I think people are going to email me about this my email is Gary atx.com v y n RX email me only cuz I get too many emails email me only if something profound just happened when I do this please stop forget about this interview I hope you're enjoying it and think about one or two or three things you're struggling with right now in life forget about even business and just tell me if you replace the or thinking with and thinking I can do both and that and that and that not or by the way this happens all the time in my life when I do this with my inner circle of friends Family Associates it's shocking what happens to your ability to solve a problem when you follow and versus or and so if something just unlocked for you and you like are on your way please let me know CU I'd love to the answer is and of course you should do what's working it's like being a brand Gary should we Market to heavy users hell yeah we need to keep them and hopefully get another unit out of them but Gary what about prospecting new users hell yeah we want people to start the process of becoming a heavy user so of course and that's actually the issue with brand guidelines and and tone of voice it makes everything so limited nobody can make stuff and it's all politics people are treating individual social media posts like a Super Bowl commercial the meetings brother cost more than just posting the content and back to that when people are like ah change that adjective or change that color purple to Blue post both right see what works you have to try different things yeah and it remember it's an ad they're both ads if you're willing to run the same commercial on television 4,000 times on a flight why wouldn't you post the same piece of content twice with different colors or slight changeing adjective people have got it all wrong brother I'm telling you the game is broken Fortune 5000 treats social like a bastard child when it's the Golden Goose and their operational Vigor and processes are based on television which you take nine months to think through something to get it out in the world versus something that I just wrote a book called day trading on like this is dayto day and it's a amazing opportunity you can advertise every single day and things may prop and then you'll sell stuff and get insights it is crazy to me all out of absolute absolute ideology of the past audacity creatives that don't want to do in Social cuz they're too good for it forgot that they weren't good enough for Hollywood so who are they like the whole thing's broken bro the whole thing's broken yeah you know what uh kind of going off of that these Fortune 5000 companies I really wanted to hit on this particular point that we've seen so many influencers creators whatever you want to call them people that are very popular online come out with their own products right so we've seen you know Logan Paul Prime we've seen skincare Brands abound I feel like everybody's got a skincare brand nowadays but you know we've seen all these Brands come out from these creators more Niche creators and smaller creators than for example you know one guy versus dove or one guy versus GE or something like that um do you think that influencers or private Brands can ever kind of eclipse corporations in this new landscape yeah not only do I think they could I predict they will I believe that in 15 years when we wake up toothpaste deodorant potato chips sneakers all everything that there's an extraordinary amount of opportunity you know how I know this because it already happened I don't know if you heard of this brand of sneakers called Air Jordans I've heard of it yes yes okay let me tell you what the Air Jordan version is going to be in the future along the way the next LeBron Kobe or Jordan somebody in the next 20 years will have the courage to instead of taking the hundred million bag from Reebok or Nike or under arour they're going to do it themselves and I know people are like ah Gary but Supply CH I can get it but too many of the things are getting commoditize supply chain distribution and it's just very clear to me now that's a tough one because of supply chain and distribution but what is not tough is pretzels what is not tough is tissues and and and so these humans have so much awareness built in and so much relevance built in they're winning on relevance and awareness it's all the same the game's the same Gary you don't believe in reaching frequency it's the only thing I believe in I don't believe that grps and digital programmatic impressions are actual awareness I think you're buying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on potential reach not actualized reach I think I'm just buying media on places that are actually reached that's it by the way I don't care about social media I'm going to make fun of social media in 10 years when our attention somewhere else I used to love email and banner ads brother when you were baby what year were you born 1994 man I love it when you were 3 years old I was buying banner ads on winespectator.com and getting 6% clickthrough do you know how insane that is I don't know if you know about banner ads numbers these days 0.0000 like like but it was the early internet and the few people probably at the time tens of thousands that were going to winespectator.com the most Progressive guys and gals on Wall Street and law firms in New York City that like were early movers that were into wine they looked at the banner ad cuz we didn't know any better that was part of the Full Experience now it's gone the only reason social's winning is the ads are natively integrated to the experience the feed is the feed is the feed whereas when you're watching television Gary people still watch sports I'm like I know but they don't watch sports commercials except for the Super Bowl and so you know I think that there's a lot of that so yes I think many of the biggest brands in 15 years will be created by human-based influencers now will they see them Coast to Coast I don't think so I think the Proctor gambles and crafts and pepsic Co will end up buying those things for billions of dollars and they'll become Brands there so they'll buy them out but I think they'll be created by and I think one or two entrepreneurs will come along the way and go Evergreen you know yeah I think you know that's you make a great point there because I feel like there's this continuous dichotomy between the creat and these businesses these giant businesses cuz right you know like Wendy's has a Twitter account right all of these companies have their Tik Tok accounts some do it really well some don't do it really well but it's very very hard or a lot harder it seems for a brand to become meaningful to someone versus another person or somebody that they feel like they know um how can a brand do that I feel like the best example of this could be dual lingo on Tik Tok but um how can a brand become more humanized by having a mascot mhm you know we worked on dualingo in Lam full disclosure we work on Mug Root Beer in America right now there's no coincidence why that's crushing it's because it's us we know what to do and it's a mascot Flo from Progressive Jake from State Farm the Geico lizard they work the when I say our forefathers and mothers had it right right they did the jingles the the mascots we lost our way in the n in the '90s and advertising and have never come back we're not as cative we think as we think we are we over we overemphasize data when it's commoditized um we're we're not as good at marketing like Don Draper's dead like we don't have that level of talent if you're talented enough you do your own [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so we've got to recognize that I've built one of the largest independent advertising agencies in the world in the last 14 years the day before I started it I worked in a liquor store that shouldn't have been allowed I I'm going to say again they allowed it because all of the holding companies and the creative a and they all poo pooed and laughed at where the attention was I was able to grow that is a mistake and that's what brands are doing wrong Brands can win brother to your point you brought out Wendy's grow you brought you can bring out slim jim growth you can bring out Elf Cosmetics growth you can bring out poppy growth there's a lot of examples my guy you know what it you know what the people are like oh people will only go with humans I'm like people love Louis Vuitton handbags people love their iPhone oh my God people like people like Brands and products here's the difference humans random humans entrepreneurs are are better at marketing than agencies and Brands the reason the humans are working is they know what to do in marketing it's called the new world this is now the television for everybody who's listening I'm holding up my phone and the television has become the radio and we don't want to admit it John we do not want to admit it in agency land you know that no we do not we never did and we may never will and yes we will because we're going to be forced to agency are going to go out of business brother I don't think people get it you can only hold on to a fake environment in B2B for so long you know who didn't want streaming to happen the cable incumbents it didn't matter what they wanted you know who didn't want influencers to happen actors and actresses it didn't matter what they wanted it doesn't matter that agencies make all their money on blackbox dmps and television commercial creative the market will adjust because the brands are going to get hurt and after a while of them being hurt they're going to blame their Partners at some point listen I mean it's a big change happening and something that I don't want to miss is that you know we talk about these Fortune 5000 companies um there's also a lot in your book and just you speak about daily um about small businesses and how small businesses can kind of work together at times and how small businesses can stay alive during this time and Thrive during this time um now from that big Corporation down to a small business how does a small business um create a social strategy and how does a small business Thrive today they become the agency they have to do it internally and they have to live my life and the millions of people I see on social for their car wash and their dog walking business they have to do it and so like if you're 47 right now and you're listening and you have a you're 47 you're young you're a year younger than me and you're you're like H I don't even know what to do I don't even have a social media account but you have a sub like a sandwich shop and you have three employees at the register daily my intuition is that a lot of them are under 25 or you know potentially from uh an immigrant like you got to literally walk in as you're listening to this on the treadmill or walking your dog or on the way to the car you got to walk in the store and be like any of you want to make organic social media content for our business like you got to start making it and they're probably going to stink or they're remarkable maybe they're naturally remarkable or they do it for themselves so they knew what to do with your sandwich or your bag of chips or the or the milkshakes you sell and so what do they do they take their resources and they make creative at scale to the best of their ability and that's why I love books this is no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] job somebody in my company who's very smart goes I love the book I got to be frank with you I'm a little bit concerned I said about what they said it feels like you're giving our agency Secrets away to everyone and I said yes we may be ahead of people right now but it's not like you know like and you know JN for you that it's a little bit deeper I'm sure you have you had when you were reading you're like oh that's interesting oh aha oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's why so but I'm not going to be able to hold on to that information forever I that's why I'm so intellectually generous like it's if if I could keep it forever as a secret sauce I would make the Big Mac too and never tell anyone but it's not going to play out that way anyway so I'd rather actually build relationships and Karma and value for the world even quote unquote my competitors what I said to this executive was we don't compete with anyone there's no agency taking our business there'll be incredible agencies that beat us in pitches and things of that nature and that's wonderful we should that's just we weren't good enough or they were remarkable or the person making the subjective call wasn't ready for what we do but nobody's taking away from us we're taking away from ourselves if we're good we're good and so I I think that um why I'm so excited and why I write books is for 28 bucks or 20 bucks or whatever this ends up being on Amazon you know a small business owner literally gets the blueprint literally and the resources back to your question will be down to normally just them themselves or the employees they have or if they're a bigger small business they can hire someone to do it and that's the game mhm and you know I I appreciate you bringing up that concern from your employee um who said that you're giving away secrets and you know cuz a concern that I would have actually writing a writing a book like this uh that talks about the social media landscape and how you can be a part of it and what you can do uh very eloquently may I add um the only thing that I would be concerned about is that in a year it would be completely different like writing a book in 2023 writing putting out a book in 2024 in 2026 I mean everything could be completely Topsy Turvy you'll love this not everything but certain things are already different I by the way I wish I could have backed up the Ocean Spray starting to this book with the mango gummies part it would have made the book better I would have given you two examples of sellout from one social media post so of course things will change but minimum first of all and I I I hope you captured this I wrote it in a manner that will allow people to create the macro strategy framework and that won't change if things that I see coming like Vine coming back and it being good like I didn't get a chance to tell you what best practices on Vine are in this book so that will be missing so to your point every day that the book is alive it has the potential and likelihood of being a little less relevant on the flip side I'm pretty fortunate we are so and I am so ahead of the masses on this including including anybody and everybody in Madison Avenue marketing um that there's going to be a lot of value in The Upfront right I mean there's going to be me breaking down did you do any of the QR codes like did you actually like look at yeah yeah I did I that was really fun I've never seen that in a book before actually yeah so everybody I put QR codes to the posts that I was talking about in the book you know my belief is that if for someone who's incentivized to be great at this going to do one case study in the book One QR code one reading what I had to say about it and be like oh okay and then like literally be better the next day and all of a sudden instead of getting 4,000 views per their videos get 8,000 and that feels incredible and so I think there'll be more than enough value for the 28 bucks for everybody who reads it from a Creator an influencer a small business an executive I mean talk a lot about LinkedIn one of the people that should definitely be buying this book are people that are in jobs that are not fulfilling them if they get good at LinkedIn they're going to get new job offers right right and that's how you do it so and I I completely agree um and also you know with that said um you did say before that agencies will have a tough time at some point right um what does the future look like at Vayner media Vayner X to you where are you guys going what's next overall or in an AI environment oh overall but maybe hit on the AI environment too I'd love to hear that yeah I think you know we are remarkable at content creation at low cost that is high value you know obviously we're going to integrate those kind of tools and everybody's going to get better and better at that and so we have to stay on top of that so I pay attention to that in the in the macro man I really think I'm going to build the largest independent advertising agency in the world I'm getting dangerously close as it is why didn't K's out there doing its thing big shout out but like we're really um we're really ambitious over here you know one thing I will say I'm very proud of this one thing I can easily predict and I hate predicting I believe that in 15 years I will be you know 60 you know what am I turn 63 62 depending on the timing um and I'm going to poke my head up and be like wait a minute 13 of the Fortune 500 CMOS came up as a kid at Boehner this is remarkable that to me I got to tell you brother I said that for two reasons one for all the leaders here nothing should be at the top of your list more than the people that work with you and for you to have success whether in your or outside of your organization and two I say it because I can't wait to clip this in 15 years and split screen it and say I told you because what I do know right now is and this is a real play actually this is a huge play to anybody who's 40 to 50 maybe even 35 to 55 in marketing right now either on the holding company agency side or in a corporation please don't put your head in the sand to what's going on this is about to Devour the whole industry what happened in streaming to regular TV and and cable is about to happen in advertising and and vayer and I will benefit but there's so much more room than just us to benefit from it we're a pimple on the ass so many of you can really change your career directory but you've got to get good at where attention really is and what creative is required to fill that attention to make the action of the buy whatever the buy represents the donation the vote uh the consideration to do something it's it's just imperative and I just think people are mailing it in and they think they're going to be okay CU they know programmatic or Google or I don't know I I'm just shocked that people are willing to let this tornado take them up and you know you to kind of end with this I feel like you mentioned AI before for and AI becoming I mean there's a lot lot of stuff happening with AI today obviously at the time of recording GPT 40 just came out um everybody's kind of in a tail spin about that but with AI kind of being on the Forefront with I don't know potential Tik Tok band looming probably going to take a while but if that happens but Tik Tok as well is advertising content that is made with AI for example nowadays um so where do you see social media going if AI content starts to flood the platforms and has a situation there I mean there's there's plenty of content now flooding like I'm not worried about content flooding I'm I'm worried about people outflanking the commodity so I'm going to say this nice and slow when not if when the platforms themselves are helping you generate the creative cuz it's their algorithms and it's going to help you create content that's going to do well on the platform mid Journey doesn't know what the hell's going inside of meta pipes but meta does mid journe is the commodity not meta right right but what happens when everybody's using that all of a sudden you know this you've seen this cuz you pay attention there's like a trend of what content works I started the trend of like chopping up your podcast into a th pie like but then now everyone like I've got a lot of offsprings there's a lot of my kids out there you know um but but then I have to adjust and so when when the content is commoditized because everyone's doing it it means the content by Nature won't be as effective as we want it to be and that's what gets into prompt engineering and that's what gets into creative thinking and critical thinking and strategy it is day trading attention yeah I'm really happy with this title I'll tell you why it hit me the other day on a chat I never thought of it prior to two days ago day trading attention how to actually build brand and sales in the new social media world this is my dummy series I'm going to write a book in 10 years that says day trading attention how to actually build brand and sales in the new VR world the reason I'm comfortable with this book is I'm going to help people strategically create the framework of execution and then they just have to be good at paying attention to platforms and culture daily to then do the thing that's what I think well uh Gary thank you so much for the time today thanks for some advice thanks for some wisdom thanks for some chats it's been really really fun I hope to see you again real soon thank you my friend [Music] oh
