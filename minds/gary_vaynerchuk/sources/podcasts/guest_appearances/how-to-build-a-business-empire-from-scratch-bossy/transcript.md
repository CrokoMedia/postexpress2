# How To Build a Business Empire From Scratch — BOSSY

I'm very obsessed with popular culture what rappers on the come up which streamers on the come up which actresses on the come up then things like you know the Stanley Cups I could have told you was going to happen a month before it hit everybody's radar yeah why did the mango gummies that are made by nice the private label at Walgreens sell out right like I'm paying attention to popular culture i dm' Bad Bunny in 2017 I'm really in it like why why why why do people care about this person Why was Charlie demilio's first business meeting in my office why did we discover Logan Paul on Vine attention is the number one asset Gary hi thank you so much for hanging out with us today you know one of the things we talk about on this show is business and sort of building out your Empire and you've got a a solid would you call it an Empire I I would I would and I and I I mean I say that because I think everyone should be thinking that way yeah right and like obviously I am either crazy you know good or it's crazy bad but I enjoy having a lot of different businesses many of my most successful friends Raz me for being all over the place or Gary if you just focused and I'm like look I'm not trying to maximize money I'm trying to maximize happiness woo you know and so for me I get joy out of starting a new business or a venture um and I and I'm also good at it's not like all my companies go out of business most of my things work to some so I enjoy it and yeah I think it's fun to think of it that way but that's an insular game I'm not worried about how it's viewed from the outside but for myself I do think I have the ambition to build something meaningful you think most of your things work to some degree can you talk about some degree like how do you define work yeah that's a great you know like here are the core things I've done in my life right like I built my dad's wine business for him it was a $3 million business when I walked into it when I left it a decade later it was a $65 million business making a lot more profit than it was at at three it was making 10% gross profit at 65 it was making 24% gross profit so a much better business I decided that I wanted to be a successful author I've had five New York Times bestselling books I wanted to be a successful public speaker I'm one of the most compensated speakers in the world yeah I wanted to build a personal brand I've done that I started Vayner media an advertising agency it is now currently one of the two or three largest independent global agencies in the world I wanted to Be an Effective investor I invested in Facebook and Twitter and Tumblr and snap and coinbase I've done very well in that world uh vayer Sports is something my brother runs but I'm very involved in we wanted to do a sports agency we're sitting here today filming on the day of the NFL draft and it is very likely though it's an unpredictable thing that we will have someone go in the first round of the NFL draft big shout out Kool-Aid uh and you know and so you know be friends is a real thing like you know know I think and V friends is the most fun cuz it got it was in that nft world so that's where all the attention is but quietly even though it's loud quietly right now I'm building a very large intellectual property a Pokemon Marvel Sesame straight L brand called be friends I have a kids book coming out in a couple months I have a cartoon coming out on YouTube kids by the people that do Coco melon if you go to eBay right now and type in vriends you will be stunned by by the completed items and sales of the trading cards I founded resi yeah and honestly I could keep going you could keep going and so that's a lot of stuff you're doing a lot of stuff and and how are you H what is the recruitment process like for you for finding leaders of all these different businesses what a great follow-up question I like to grow them okay what does that look like it looks like patience let me explain what let me let me explain what right real most of the things I mentioned now are more recent so Wine Library was forever right it was from 1998 to 2011 full-time Vayner media started 9 I went full fulltime at 11: which is how I'm referencing the Wine Library thing and then like a lot of the stuff I just mentioned really started happening in 20189 and so in that seven eight years when I was building when you look at it right AJ runs AJ runs Vayner Sports AJ and I with our partner Phil Toronto run the fund uh the fund Phil Toronto started as an intern for us I I didn't mention that I started empathy wines which was a direct consumer wine brand that I sold for a lot of money to consolation Brands my two partners in that business John trowman and Nate rer both were interns at Vayner media 10 years earlier yeah they're coming up with homegrown leaders yeah V friends is is uh run by Andy cranc who was also an intern Vayner media Global La who runs la le Buckley she's been with me for 7even years who's the chief business officer kayn mcnamar she's been with me for 10 years the Sasha group with she's a company in the holding company of Vayner X where Vayner media is he's been with me for 15 years right you know like there's I mean dozens Chief of Staff Hannah N9 years like but all of the people I just mentioned started as kids all of them yeah it is very rare for me to bring someone from the outside in a very substantial role because they're not family interesting so for me it's family business vibes okay because I I know a lot of people who listen to this show they're starting a business or they're thinking of starting a business and they're trying to figure out how to get people to help them and work with them if I think about myself there I have a couple companies and I own a couple companies and I feel sometimes overwhelmed by having multiple and I also feel sometimes frustrated by the fact that the person that I find in the leadership is not ready immediately but I'm hearing you say that's maybe not the goal that they need to be immediately ready ready they they almost never can be yeah like hiring from the outside is guessing yeah right hiring is guessing promoting and firing is knowing yeah o that's a good one that's hiring is guessing promoting and firing is knowing why is promoting and firing knowing cuz you've made a decision based on the reality of them being with you performance right do you know that I've never called a reference in my entire career H Ever it's crazy you're going to give me a piece of paper with the three people you already talked to to say that they're going to coign you when I call them you pick the people so instead what do you do you give them a project no that's a great idea what I do is I go with my intuition MH now what is fun at scale remember let's take a step back I just rattled off a lot of stuff and I'm and I'm really empathetic that most people are not 20 years into their successful career yeah so let's go back to day one for me let's start with a couple things when I was only Hing people that were making $7 an hour minimum wage in New Jersey at the time to do stocking the shelves at Wine Library I would predominantly either want to hire acquaintances or friends yeah or once I had a good employee I wanted their cosign to who I should hire ah okay yeah so a good thing for smaller business when you hire your first person doesn't work out you hire someone else doesn't work out now you hire a third person does work out Sarah's killing it now you're ready for another hire the first thing I do is I go to Sarah and say Sarah who have you worked with or who's a friend of yours or a family member that's like you cuz Sarah knows what it takes to do the role well too and you trust Sarah cuz she's already doing good work now occasionally Sarah will put on someone who she loves more than the job and you might get caught but but I found less often I feel like that Sarah in this story is a is a good egg and you're coming to her from a really empathetic honest place and she wants to keep growing and and so she wants to make a good recommendation I love and I mean love creating like in sports they call it a coaching tree right there's a head coach and he has a bunch of assistants and they go on to be good I love hiring trees you hire a good employee especially if you're further along at vayer I can do this all day long now you hire someone they come from another advertising agency that they worked at for 6 years they come and work for you they're there for 9 months they're crushing it I will always to that person be like who else is good yeah who's like you and almost have them build their own team essentially even if and in that scenario back for to my company they may be a creative director but they're like oh you know who's great at project management Sandra who I us to work at at droga 5 which is a great agency or you know and so I I think a lot about that and so if you're just starting out you're guessing you're guessing but then you have someone rely on them too Gary I'm curious you did just rattle off I wanted to do this I did it I wanted to do this I did it and then you said I've been doing this for 20 years like I've had the time to really explore these different paths is there anything that sticks out in your mind is something that just flat out didn't work the L what's l oh I have many I mean there's a lot of L's and but I think the L's for me are micro l so okay like there's been many divisions in V vayer sampling inside of Vayner media was something I'm so passionate about like I still think most companies don't sample Beauty food beverage like sampling get people to taste your soap they may like it it's unlimed ading so a lot of Divisions have not worked a lot of executions I would say like the macro thing most of it has worked because I'm cons I'm actually conservative I'm very PR I'm an immigrant I'm practical I'm not like spending money I can't afford to lose you know I'm also good at what I do I you know it's it's first of all professionally you know I'm getting older it's 26 years that I've been fed up but that's not even true I've been really really in my dad's liquor store business since I was 14 by the time I was 22 and ran it full-time I was experienced yeah like the day I walked in after college I knew everything there was like at least by the when I say I knew everything I mean and how to run the liquor store yeah yeah and I mean everything I knew how to stock the shelves I knew how to make the ice I knew how to fill the beer cooler I knew how to ring up the register I knew how to buy wine I knew how to sell like I knew everything and so you know um yeah I mean I think only very side vanity projects have completely failed there was a company I started called Vayner toys where I took a couple buddies and I just wanted them to post everything I was buying at garage sales on eBay it was just not a very good business model but it was I was that was a hobby you know like true true things not really cuz I've done a lot of things but not like I know I just rattled off a lot of things but not a lot there was a lot of things that failed for me where I wasn't active so I bought corked c r k d this may go back to what you're dealing with I bought corked C KD back in 201 um no nine nine which was a wine social network okay it was epic I loved it I was obsessed with it and then I in I bought it big shout out Dan cedarholm amazing guy but I I hired Lindsay Harvard Business School who's amazing I love Lindsay and ironically John Troutman who was my partner in empathy wines who now is a key player at V friends was an intern for it yeah but I was so busy back to being busy like I'd never run a lot of things I only ran Wine Library and now we just started vayer media and so two things was busy for me I didn't have the infrastructure yet I didn't have three full-time admins I didn't have two chief of staffs I didn't have 50 people around me that have been with me for 10 years and I can talk sympatic go with you have do you have all these things now you have time ad I didn't have I didn't have the broad shoulders of being able to I could juggle two three balls but I wasn't me yet this version I couldn't do 12 and so cell phones weren't like that where everyone could be reachable like you had to like so the world was different for me and so corked I said Lindsay you run it and I was giving it like an hour a week and it it failed and by the way not only did I do corked I did another thing called Forest which was with Kyle bragger which was like this social network for developers and designers kind of like dribble yeah right failed because I was the not only the 1B I was like the number four I was barely involved but I'll take that L because I was the co-founder partner but I've never failed in anything where I've been the one driving sometimes when I've been in the passenger seat definitely when I've been in the back seat but if I'm the driver we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] winning this is something this is something I'm trying to figure out for myself this is something I'm really kind of playing with and I love your thoughts and advice on this because when I have multiple businesses that I'm running if I'm giving a lot of attention to it I'm sort of giving my like Terra factor to it it works out very well and when I'm more pulled back from it I maybe you're right it's like an infrastructure thing I haven't figured out how to like Infuse my energy enough into it so that it works and it maybe sounds a little bit like cocky for me to say like oh if I'm part of it it works works and if I'm not part of it it doesn't but that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's not cocky that's like saying like when Tom Brady's on the Patriots they're good and when he's not he's not they're not like I view it like sports by the way I hate I use Tom Brady as an example that just pissed me I'm a huge Jets Manan [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate him the player yeah I hear he's a nice guy um no that makes all the sense in the world well it reminds me of like so I run a personal finance media brand and a very common refrain is like millionaires have seven streams of income and I think the average person who maybe has a W2 job hears that and goes okay I got to get seven jobs let me immediately diversify how I'm earning and that's not really I don't think how it works like you have to you have to go full force at one thing and then you you layer on as you go and that I think some of these things can proliferate and create multiple streams of Revenue within one source of focus I don't know that that's exactly what you're talking about because you do have different no no no no no that's what I am saying it's why you said that was I said it earlier like in 2012 I couldn't do seven things I didn't have the infrastructure I didn't have the experience yet I had the talent but I had to be patient you know as you were just talking as we're talking I'm like man you know what's really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up right now is that every 20-year-old on Earth thinks that they need to become a millionaire in their 20s and no 20-year-old on Earth 40 years ago thought that yeah they thought it was going to take time to get there H well I do want to ask you about content creation because when you walked in you brought someone with you who filming you we're obviously filming you as well and you said for the first 5 years I had someone filming me every single minute of the day and I go oh well that makes sense because I followed you on social media and you were everywhere all the time all at once and I thought how the hell is this guy doing this how is he constantly producing so much stuff and to this day I go look at Gary V audio experience every single day there's a new episode and I'm like like I'm exhausted just watching this but I'm curious from your perspective a how how were you kind of ahead of the curve there how how did you think about it at the time and how has your perspective shifted on on the production of media and and like what you are personally creating what you're putting out there great question I I think that you know it's funny you bring this up because it's obviously I'm in pocket right now where day trading tension is about to come out so this book is very this is going to be very interesting for me to I'm very detached for my by the way another thing that makes everything work for me is I'm I'm genuinely detached from Gary ve interesting say more about that how was that yeah I don't I don't get my satisfaction in life I don't get my validation in life from my professional success okay so when you say you're detached from Gary Vee you mean like the Persona of of Gary Gary B is me like no that's the the fame that comes the awareness or fame or whatever you want to call it the financial success the admiration because I'm an entrepreneur and it's cool right now I'm very like it's almost like I'm watching it from here even though I'm living it and the reason I bring that up is what I'm about to say I'm so curious to see what this book does MHM more from like watching it from the sidelines than actually living in it and what I mean by that is I know I wrote a very important book it may hit it may not meaning it's going to sell cuz I'm good at that and people are going to but I mean hit hit right I mean do I think the two of you might read it yes I do because of what you do but but do I think this one might be the one that you read and you're like wait a minute I need every single person I meet to read this and because it's going into what you just asked what I realized since I was a child was that attention was the only thing that mattered and I don't mean attention like look at me I mean if you were to sell something and it started with lemonade I'm being dead serious about what I'm about to tell you it took me 25 years 30 years to remember this I did on stage improv once I was like wait a minute like literally I was giving a talk trying to make a point about attention like wait a minute when I was a child six seven eight child when I sold lemonade I made Robbie turnic or my sister Liz sell the lemonade and I walked up and down the street on tingly Lane made signs and with lit you know how crazy what I'm about to say is would literally sit on the grass on the corner and like watch 30 cars drive by and was trying to like look at the person's face and be like should I put it on that tree or that pole like do they look at the tree or the pole where are they putting their attention yes so that I could put my sign there and sell my lemonade ah uh that is like god-given that you knew this is a kid where is the customer putting their attention I I didn't even think of it that way I didn't even I it took me 30 years to remember it yeah but then I was like wait a minute and then when I was 14 and doing baseball card shows I used to walk the whole show and listen to what people were talking about what did people care about and then I would go and I would set up my table and then I'd go off around my table not be behind my table and I would stand behind people and I would watch them walk by my table and try to get a sense of what would stop them if my best friend BR Warick he was listening right now he'd be laughing about the dollar Rack or like the Donis 89 box Tower I would do things to stop people which is very different than I think how most people approach marketing or think they're supposed to do marketing which is I make something first and then I wave my hands and like try to get their attention to me as opposed to looking at where their attention is already going the reason I've always been right about this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is that the reason the reason I did a YouTube show in February 2006 the reason I had a website in 1997 the reason I did email marketing in 1998 or bought the first Google AdWords for wine or was the person yelling to all of you six years ago Tik tok's going to win Tik tok's going to win that's me yeah and so you know what did I see back then which was content on social media platforms was everything and there was no way for me to produce enough to take advantage of it unless I recorded my whole day I'm curious where you're looking now because I do think that like when I watch you even today it does not occur to me that on a daily basis team Gary ve is going where is the attention today it's like Gary ve is everywhere correct but it's everywhere that the attention is I'm not doing a Drive Time radio show yeah yeah I'm not writing an optin for the Wall Street Journal every day and I think it's even more nuanced in like where the attention is I'm hearing you say too what kinds of things are people paying attention to the tone well my framework is pack platforms and culture okay platforms and culture okay so which platforms and then what are the platforms doing so yes Instagram but what kind of content should you be making for Instagram right now and I'm not talking about the culture part culture is popular culture who's popping what's popping what do people care about if you two ladies think that I thought I was going to make content about cliche mistakes that parents make 10 years ago I would have laughed you out of the room wasn't on my mind but it became a bigger conversation for both kids and parents cuz the world's evolving so if you're looking at where people's attention already is and kind of figuring out how you can put your business your brand in front of that there are some and contrib you know it's funny cont yeah I think the reason I broke out was you said it right like 99.999% will said advertising it's brand building put in front of I've always thought of contribute to okay so this actually answers what I was getting ready to ask you because I was going to say if you're thinking about is advertising I think about there's lots of things people are doing on social media that I think are silly and stupid and they're doing a dance and like I that's not what I want to do to put my attention to but that's not necessarily the way I want to contribute so I think you're saying when you also add the lens of how do you want where people attention and how do you want to contribute to that multiple things to that one I personally for I do for a living think nothing is silly yeah because I think the audience is right yeah I think most people think they're right and I think I'm always wrong and the audience is always right so if people find it entertaining to see someone eat 10 Pizza pies then people see it like the amount of Envy the amount of delusion that that people come to the table with when they strategize around this is astonishing to me people like Gary this is all so stupid look at this person they're ridiculous I'm like they're not is Jim Carrey ridiculous because Jim carre is silly as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah but he but what comedy is is escapism yeah the world is hard yeah and it's nice to put on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Netflix and watch a 1 hour standup special and laugh yeah often times about what's complicated in the world you know uh models what do they contribute I hear from so many people this is like I'm like they contribute fantasy they contribute they ask INSP Iration they contribute you're sexually attracted to them that's a human trait like it's a you know so like is a valuable thing it's a you know everything is and then there's information there's education what was I contributing to Wine in 2006 I was very educated and could really speak to it but I was taking the douchery out of it that's what I Wasing right I was a normal Jersey guy oh wait a minute like I can like wine and be like into wrestling and UFC and like trading cards and like the Jets so you have a thesis kind of about how what you want to do differently how you want to contribute how do you want to contribute you know to me I think the number one reason people come to me all the time as you can imagine be like Gary I'm not growing this isn't working I'm like cuz you're selfish every time you post you're like what's in it for me I want likes I want followers I want fame I want money I want the attention what are they getting I used to think about content cuz as part of money with Katie we have content across a lot of different platforms and I in the beginning kind of conceptualized of it like a very linear funnel okay I'm going to find you you're going to find me on Instagram and then you're going to go on to listen to my podcast and then I'm going to get you to read my newsletter and then I'm and I think it was a very like I want to move you along and so the Instagram content needs to drive you here and then this needs to drive you here and I think what I've been learning over the last year or two is like no no no you need to optimize the audio experience to be as good as possible for that audio listener without the intention of taking them somewhere else you want them to become as big of a fan of as possible and give them the best possible experience there on Instagram it needs to be a social first video you need to be thinking platform first and platform specific versus here's something that I'm trying to get you to really go somewhere else but poke holes in that like cuz I I think I'm not not only am I not going to poke holes in it let me tell you what you just described which is why the last 20 years have been fruitful for me and why so many others have not been able to achieve their goal and not just me many others you just describe two very different things when it comes to business okay the first thing you described was sales okay yeah the second thing you described was branding interesting okay the first thing you were thinking about was I need to get them through a sales funnel a funnel y to get them to do this thing that will make me money M nothing wrong with that I like business but that's sales the second you started to transition and think about brand things changed yeah like like the the night this this sneaker they didn't cookie me and follow me around the internet and then like I saw a banner everywhere and I I buy Nikes because of the brand interesting not because of the sales yeah right and so why I think things worked for me and what I want others to do for others is I'm desperate to provide value I'm happy to sell books I want to sell vfriend Collectibles I want to sell you know wine but if I didn't like I want people to sign up for winetext.com which by the way I want you to you two should as well I think I've really hacked the best way to buy wine on the internet but I don't want them to buy win.com because I pound them with you know a funnel you're just beating them down I want them to I want whoever's listening right now to have so much Affinity that I've brought them value and they're like yeah I do buy my wine from wine.com but I like Gary better so I'm going to go sign up right now to win.com do you know what I mean brand brand it's a little more human well listen Brand's a lot more fun for individual humans too agree like to your point like we feel better like when we're building brand versus just selling mhm you feel better it also works better yeah so you're making a lot of content I'm curious about how much content you're consuming do you have a lean media diet lean social media diet are you I consuming I consume an obnoxious amount of content at a surface level okay that's interesting how is it surface I'm just trying to know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on yeah and I don't care about but but what everyone cares about but I don't need to be deep in it so you're not in the comments debating with everybody on somebody else's post but you're just what they're saying I'm never going to do that because if you're debating in the comments some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] went down that you're wasting your energy I may debate a little bit about sports I may go into a 76ers post right now and talk a little Nick [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but but no no no I'm definitely not doing that but I am trying to pay attention to what's happening in the world I'm very obsessed with popular culture yeah right so what rappers on the come up which streamers on the come up which actress is on the come up then things like you know the Stanley Cups I could have told you was going to happen a month before it hit everybody's radar yeah right why did the popular culture like 4 years ago I'm like oh this mad happy Brand's going to hit yeah right things like that seag and Stables like why did I you know 18 months ago I'm like oh that's going to hit like you know like so whether it's fashion or food food Trends or music trends like I went back like I dm'd Bad Bunny in 2017 2017 shout shout out to Mike Boyd who puts me on to that stuff Tyler Walsh too now but like like I'm really in it and so I'm paying attention like like to why did the Cronut happen why did corduroy hats happen you know like like why why why why do people care about this person Why was Charlie demilio's first business meeting in my office why did we discover Logan Paul on Vine like I've been doing this forever so you're looking at everything that's happening on social you're always filming yourself you've got a bunch of businesses do you feel comfortable not being busy yeah I do I actually do um but I don't I don't feel comfortable not thinking okay so that's where like my brain doesn't turn off but it's not stressed this goes back to the Detachment thing yeah like like I don't enjoy like it's actually funny in EXT vacationing I enjoy doing nothing yeah Beach plop eat sleep seea one week later right like like chill but like on a on a week first of all I try to maximize my family time to the fullest so as you can imagine like if if I'm not working it's going to be family stuff whether it's a family dinner whether it's the weekend whether it's a vacation so like it's family right and then like if I find time where it's just me like you know or with one family member what have you like yeah it's not that I have to be doing something like I I can Lounge like I can like sit on a couch and watch a I watched the entire Wednesday Adams Wednesday thing on Netflix one afternoon I'll do stuff but here's why it's weird I'll take the other angle on this today I'm going to work all day and it won't feel like it for real for real yeah you know like like I would I would rather do the 31 meetings I'm going to have today then if you said hey let's go skiing or like let's clear the calendar and cook and listen to music I don't want to like it's not bad is that though because you have you're only accepting opportunities that you are excited about are you curating it that way or is that the whole thing kind of excites you and so like you are just it's it's a great question dayto day there's 30% of what I'm doing that I'm eating [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cuz I'm operating things I don't want to be doing MH you know I don't want to be on the call I was on the way here apologizing to a client for something I don't want to be doing that I got to do that it you know like so there's a lot of got yeah but you nailed it but in the macro I'm operating yeah you know I'm an operator and you like doing it it's fun that's the play when I met you I I almost immediately got a couple things one the Detachment was really clear in the way that you're kind of like you're chill real way yeah you're not attached to an outcome of this has to go really well you're not like you're pressed you're not pressed he's not giving pressed energy I'm just not I'm I'm and I also don't think I'm anyone yeah right not only am I not pressed I also prefer humility over ego yeah you know like to me what's attractive is when people don't think they're better then yeah you know I'm I'm in a very weird part of my life where the circumstances of what I was passionate about as a kid that wasn't cool business wasn't cool when I was coming up has now become the coolest yeah and all of a sudden people are putting me on a pedestal in the street at an airport at the Knicks game and I'm so grateful and it feels so remarkable but I don't think it means I'm somebody do you know what I mean like I don't think it means that I'm better than them it means that they think business is cool and I'm cool to them the same way that I think Josh Hart is the coolest because I think basketball is cool but just cuz Josh Hart's a better basketball player than be doesn't mean that he's a better man than me and vice versa just cuz I'm a great entrepreneur doesn't mean I'm a better man than someone and so that's how I think about it yeah so today we're talking about a lot of like building of Empires and really I think you're touching on what you're life could look like optimizing for maybe being less pressed or optimizing for Joy I'm hearing you talk about what you want to take on what that that's what it looks like maybe when you start building an empire we want to play a little game with you before we wrap up that is sort of centered around what it looks like to think about creating an Empire go ahead so do you know that game f Mary kill yes okay so we have like a version to say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on this I we can say okay got it just wanted to make sure we can say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] okay um but we have a version of that which is like invest compete acquire okay invest compete acquire compete means that I enjoy competing with them cuz I admire it or I want to compete with them because I think I can beat them it means I'm going to give you three we'll give you three companies and you pick one you want to invest in one you want to compete with and one you would would require I'll answer real quick compete compete compete no you got to pick one of I'm kid I'm kidding I'm joking go ahead twitch social media Edition okay twitch Tik Tock x/ Twitter very interesting twitch so I'm going to make this really Val for the audience me break down yeah let me break it down so cuz I'm taking this way too serious already the Pressed went away now he's pressed about the answer marry [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill and this is and the and the way invest compete acquire invest compete acquire twitch Tik Tok Twitter back to being a day trader I can't take things macro I have to take them in the way it is right now okay okay Tik tok's going to be banned in America M and they're not going to sell it to anyone it's just going to be gone so compete invest compete acquire compete with Tik Tok cuz I'm going to win by default cuz they're going to get disqualified you're paying attention to what's happening in the market conditions that's the attention by the way this first time I'm saying it public I really think that's what's going to happen now which is wild ass [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk about someone who's excited all that attention has to find new homes people are going to be I'm come on back to Instagram y'all you know you know who I think has a dark horse chance of winning heavy yeah I think Twitter's going to relaunch Vine I love Vine are you serious I love if I'm Elon and I'm sitting with that name and that IP so easy for them to build it turn it back onund everyone's going to be like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is the OG it's going to work anyway that's my little prediction um okay invest compete acquir compete with Tik Tok twitch versus X compete and acquire twitch versus X investor acquire CU you used your comp investor acquire I'm going right so these are both good right I believe in both of them I would probably acquire X because because I think X but I think elon's doing what I want always thought which was this could do a lot more Twitter didn't change for a decade yeah I think X should be the most important screaming service on Earth here's why I think X should be Netflix or Hulu because we go to x to talk about the things that are on Netflix and Hulu true it would make natural sense for them to be a major streaming service mhm I think X could be a major major streaming service where you both watch and talk about in the same place because it is the water cooler it's true and so I think there's something there there and you could really maximize 1 plus 1 equal 11 economics and so D D D D D so you build a TV into the water cooler okay got it doesn't acquire twitch acquire X invest in ttch sorry acquire X invest I would acquire X cuz I'd want to operate all the opportunities I see for it yeah and with twitch it's a great company and I love live streaming and streaming's continuing I think streaming in the place that social media was 10 years ago 10 years ago everybody knew social was big but they didn't know how big big it was yeah that's back to what I saw I think today people know streaming's big they know kaed they know Aiden Ross they know clicks they know what's happening but I don't think people understand in 10 years it's going to be like omnipresent yeah all the time well thank you so much for kind of giving us this framework of your vision and how you think about scaling and growing businesses has has been awesome thank you ladies thank you for being here
