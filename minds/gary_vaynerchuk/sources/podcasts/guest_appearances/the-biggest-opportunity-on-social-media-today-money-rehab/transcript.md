# The Biggest Opportunity On Social Media Today — Money Rehab

I believe in the next 10 years there's currently a hairdresser in her little Salon six seats in a small town right now she's got a nice business she's a killer if she puts a laptop or a camera in her salon and starts to stream the day literally I believe that that person is going to become famous and make a lot of money by not playing to the camera by literally living their life on their core activity attention is the number one asset Gary vay welcome to money rehab thanks for having me have we known each other for 100,000 years I was thinking about that the other day I think it was South by Southwest 2006 or 7 you have amazing memory by the way that was the first interactive that they had do you remember Mark did the keynote I sure do we were on like a panel about the internet Web 2.0 like social media hadn't even been coined yet that's actually not the first time we met it's the first time we met in person but we have an amazing research team and I want to show you what we found oh my God I'm excited okay this was Circa 2009 love it was the first time you were on CNN oh my God I remember this and it was wines for Valentine's Day oh my God I fully remember this I so remember that that is so good look at us how cool is that I was like 24 maybe 23 you literally look like you're in high school you look like a baby listen I think to oh my God that shirt I should have wore it that's still true it's still crazy to me how much value there is in wine cuz there's so much of it and it changes year to year and most people are so undereducated on it the amount of it's it's so funny the book that I wrote day trading attention talks about overpriced and underpriced marketing behavior and that's I think I learned it in wine the amount of people overspending on wine and the amount of deals in wine is pretty extreme well we have some gorillo for you just a bit um that's but this was hilarious I couldn't believe we found this so we your research team deserves a raise that really good stuff so when you see this guy yes what do you think I think that that dude knew what was happening which was he intuitively he was you know even though I look fairly young there I'd already been through a real decade of business building right that's 10 years into my career Gary I'm probably 32 there or something like that if it's 2009 I'm 34 there so that's why what I really understood there look at us this is so fun what I really understood there was oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is what I saw in '95 and 96 and why I launched wine library.com but at that point we were a small local liquor store doing back to money look at that book uh that is my first book you know everyone thinks crushit it's my first book so this is 2008 or 7 yeah it's earlier I think it's 2008 anyway what that dude knew was oh I'm seeing the same movie again it was only the second time I'd seen that movie now I'm probably at four times seeing that m movie which is there's a substantial shift going on and holy crap this is so cool that I'm doing CNN but I have a feeling that this Twitter YouTube viddler all these things at the time that this is going to become the thing Tumblr Tumblr you were an investor was and so that was a funny time for me because it was the first time I felt like I was sitting on information and I had a little bit that I could do with it in a way that I couldn't do anything the first time the first time it was like we we were back to money we were doing $3.8 million a year in Revenue as a liquor store on 10% gross profit so $380,000 before actual expenses of electricity payroll my father was living his American Dream by paying to own his own property and building like many immigrants so that's what he was focused on and that made sense and coming to this country with 100 bucks that is a massive accomplishment I obviously was NextGen and had a lot of Big Dreams there back to being an investor in Tumblr and Facebook and Twitter was the first time I was able to take advantage from a money standpoint back to the theme of this show and and knew that was going to build a lot of personal brand and I didn't know that that's what it was called back then I just knew that I was going to be known in the wine business in the wine World in a way that I could have never dreamed of even 2 3 years earlier cuz it's just not how the world worked now you're on your seventh Business book so eight all together uh you mentioned your dad uh as I was reading your book there is a very early call to action and you're big on call to actions uh so I did it and I emailed Sasha um I want to just check and make sure Sasha didn't write me back that's very highly likely Sasha doesn't like to write back because you know like many immigrants Sasha is insecure about his spelling which I keep telling him and my mom your son is atrocious at spelling my team I love when I send companywide emails cuz I always think about the first the person that's there first week and now we're like this thing and like I always wonder if like they see the disaster of my grammar and say am I at the right place or should I quit now uh but it is unlikely Sasha will reply to you but nonetheless what did you write Sasha hair oh it's long I didn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around Gary that that's very sweet what do you think I think you're so sweet it's going to make his day so I'm first generation American too and um and I remember that spelling insecurity like when I was applying to colleges I had to figure out for the first time do you think a lot of your hustle comes from not just like you being here but this immigrant mentality that we all share no matter where your parents came from yeah I think like you know for the people that are listening and and I think the Immigrant mentality slang for like some sort of mix of ambition and really almost like a form of lack of complaining and or a mix of gratit ude there is incredible advantages of being an immigrant in a place of opportunity like America and what I mean by that is there are plenty of Seventh Generation Americans listening right now that have full accountability don't complain tremendous ambition incredible tenacity but there's one very big truth in human life which is it's hard to be hungry when you're fed and you know for me it's very clear it's not hard to analyze when I was 12 and I wanted things and I had already at the age of 12 entered the Zone where my mother felt that she didn't need to buy things for me that if I wanted them I should go get it you can imagine selling lemonade or baseball cards or whatever I had to do shoveling snow was a big activity of mine washing cars was a big activity of mine may she rest in peace I lost a friend that I grew up with Marissa bird makes me a little emotional but like we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in Robbie turnic I know you're watching too now Andy Greco my little sister Liz we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hoses on our like like real hoses not like like you know back when they made them well like wrapped on our shoulders like bucket of water like we grinded because we grew up in an environment we like like Mommy and Daddy were not going to buy you things at Toys are Us like if we wanted bazooka from kers like we needed to find that 5 cents and it of course that became a humongous advantage and how did that change the way you dealt with money like my family just used cash I also have found that regardless of where your family's from nobody used the dishwasher did we didn't even have one like I we grew up very like just to remind everybody cuz I know there's probably a lot of people here watching that don't have a lot of context on me like I was born in the Soviet Union when we moved to Queens to immigrate to America we we lived in a studio apartment with multiple family members five six seven depending on what was going on cuz there was three Studios like we were really poor not like we weren't lower like a lot of people like talk about oh I grew up humbly and what they're saying thank God this is a wonderful thing we're in a prosperous country they mean they grew up middle class like they didn't have a BMW like we grew up like I now to my Dad's credit we weren't dirt poor for very long we were dirt poor and then we moved to do in like a little bit better C then we grew then I mainly grew up in a townhouse in Edison New Jersey which was a blue collar lower middle class neighborhood and so we didn't even have a dishwasher like I remember thinking a dishwasher was like that was status I remember thinking as old as 14 years old which would be 1989 I remember thinking that if you had a BMW or a Mercedes that would be equivalent to the way we look at the Kardashians today like private plane Yachts Elon Musk Bezos like to me if you had a Mercedes or a BMW you were filthy Filthy Rich so I got so my relationship with money though is very fascinating in hindsight which I think and you'll probably know this better than I so I'm almost asking you this question I got really lucky and fortunate that I don't have a relationship with money where I view it as validation I don't it I definitely don't weaponize it I view it as a byproduct of the thing I really love which is the game winning winning but I also love losing tell me more well I think entrepreneurship is interesting to me like I think about this a lot I love winning but I equally get great joy in losing another great podcast like yours I did where I finally broke it down was Steve Bartlett's podcast I got a lot of emails about this I talked about this thing that happens to me it actually just happened uh a couple weeks ago where we I was still at 48 play pickup basketball and you shoot for teams and sometimes if you shoot for teams instead of just mixing up teams if there's 10 guys there and you're like okay let's make this kind of even you're tall you're tall you guys split you're good you're good you stink you stink like you know which is common we always shoot for teams and sometimes when you shoot for teams the teams are obnoxiously lopsided and I especially get excited when my team is much worse and and I really weirdly like when we lose the first game 11 to2 something chemically triggers into me where I get really excited about it mode it's kind of like the the it's it's nothing like too wild other than like can we have the intestinal fortitude can we have the chemistry amongst ourselves can we be clever or figure something out to somehow now win the next game and sometimes the teams are very lops out you get your ass kicked again and can and I just talked about in this podcast like how I get enjoyment out of that and it's similar to business I don't get devastated when agendas Investments Concepts strategies or even companies I start fail I view it as that's the price of admission I don't feel entitled that because I have been historically successful that I'm allowed to be successful in the next thing I do and weirdly I like when I fail because it allows me to talk to myself of like this fun relationship of like see big shot like this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] game doesn't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about you this is real Merit [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you weren't good enough I like that it's kind of like the podcast ratings I've been doing it for a long time and it es and flows right when when I heard there was an to do the show with you I was pumped cuz we haven't seen each other in a while and then you know during that process I was like oh and I got to see how well this show is doing and that makes me so happy for you what I liked about that was when I looked at it that was the first time I'd looked in a long time and I got to see a lot of people that have been doing it for a long time and a lot of people that are merging and you see and you know this cuz you do this for a living over the last 10 years there's been like just a lot of es and flows like there was multiple years where my podcast was in top 100 consistently overall that is not where I am now and I think I deserve that because I know that I'm not putting everything into my podcast right now because I'm putting into other things I like that I Des I feel like you do deserve to be where you are and you're right cuz you're doing it and I don't know I'm obsessed with merits why I love sports like you could talk anything you want but they're going to play tonight a tennis match is going to happen a basketball game is going to happen and everybody can talk but the game's going to play out and game's going to be the game and business is the closest thing to that I like that there's Merit in it and I don't want to only like the game for what I get out of it I want to love the game for the game and then because that's my obsession yes I got fortunate my passion wasn't painting it wasn't singing it wasn't gardening or golfing my passion was entrepreneurship the byproduct if you're good at that is there is economic upside no different by the way than if you're a remarkable athlete or actress or things of that nature but I find a lot of people that grow up with little become overly obsessive and have a very unhealthy relationship with money they use it as a makeup or a Band-Aid to close up feelings that they had from that era I grew up in a very fortunate environment which was we didn't have a lot of money but I was happy all the time cuz my mother was such a supernova so I was one of those lucky people who learned that money isn't the anecdote to happiness and I actually believe the people that are most happy in the world are the ones who don't grow up with a lot and grew up with extreme happiness cuz they're taught from day one there is no correlation to happiness and money and I'm very grateful for that well thank you for the kind words for the show you've been super kind I've always leg you've always I've always thought from that moment to this second and every moment in between cuz I love watching the game the world people things you're very tenacious you're very talented it always made sense to me why you would have wins back at and you're just a good dude you answer all your emails I called you when I was launching rich [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that was my first book 10 years ago I didn't know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I was doing and you were on I don't know number three at that point um and you said to me you were so so generous with your time I came in in New York and uh you said do podcasts and that time I was like okay and I told my Publishers and they're like where do you find podcasts it was a different era and here we are like a podcast Network later and you were absolutely right that was where the conversion was happening you also told me to uh write a list of everybody I knew go off the grid for two weeks contact them right the reason I was the reason I looked at Dustin is it is still advice I give to anyone who's selling books if you're selling books you've lived a life where you've done a lot of good things for a lot of people and asking is okay as long as you don't judge them if they don't deliver the reason people struggle with my advice in selling books is their feelings get hurt when someone doesn't buy a bunch when they know they've done great by them I've had some extrem I mean I have one example that I will never forget to the day I die and it does not bother me one bit but I use it all the time and I'll use it right now because I it's a opportunity to teach people a lesson of what happens when you have expectations and how happy you can be if you don't so you're right when someone's selling a book I really think it's a good idea to go off the grid for a week which is nice you get some rest before you go hard it's it's a lot easier to just lay on the beach and go literally a through z in your phone and your inbox and say hey this means something to me I've gone really serious about this I feel proud of it it would mean the world to me if you can buy a bunch one or a bunch or something else right or really specific like can you send out this tweet whatever platform maybe they have more people or but it's funny I to your point I think it's I believe that if and I'm saying this out loud so I expect friends to reach out to me in the future I think it's more important I think I make a bigger impact and I have a very big I have a very big platform I still believe me buying 300 books for a friend that I really know that really asked and put them in the lobbies of all 10 of our Vayner X offices is going to sell more books potentially than a single tweet of like hey Johnny's book is awesome or Sally's book is awesome now it could be the other way but like really AC asking the problem is when I used to tell that advice and I've been telling it for a long time a I didn't realize how many people were so grounded in insecurity and envy and resentment early on the first three or four people that I told to do that they would reach out to me and be like this was horrible I was like what happened they're like well I did get on the new like it did work but like now I'm really mad at Rick and I'm like why well I yeah Rick didn't buy anything and I've been so nice to Rick and I was like and it made me think about the most impactful story I have on this which is I asked someone who I reopened reopened meaning an investment was closed it was done I went to back for this person to the founder to reopen round and let them put $50,000 in or 100 I don't remember an investment the company went on to have a massive exit this person made heavy eight figures and when I went and asked for a book by they bought none and ghosted me and I remember that being a really exciting moment for me because it was when I was able to call my bluff on myself I genuinely mean what I'm about to say I've continued to have a relationship with this person like you know later on I genuinely don't judge the person cuz my brain goes to maybe they were busy I asked by the way I asked four times because I knew I made this person lots of lots of money I was like this guy can buy 500 copies you know like I really knew I'm so grateful and thankful for my parenting my DNA my Circumstance the fact that I have no real feelings against that I just only know how to deploy optimistic compassion right maybe he was in a bad place maybe I don't know who am I to judge and don't forget here's the big key to this Nicole and I hope this lands for people I was asking when you ask you're not allowed to judge but it's vulnerable well but but but here's my thing when you're asking you're the one asking when people get mad at people for not reciprocating they ask I remind them all I'm like you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] asking like don't look a gift horse in the mouth or whatever the saying is I just believe there's something very powerful around expectation if you're able to get into a place where you're just not expecting you're only control yourself and so anyway I don't know how we got there but that's oh your book yes I look I think you're you're pissed I honestly I'm I'm being dead serious with you I when I realized oh my God this person's not going to buy it I was in order baffled cuz he just made tens of millions of dollars B B I'm being just very vulnerable and transparent baffled B quickly to hope he's okay to see oh I really don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about this this is epic I actually eat my own dog food I talk about no expectation I literally know every detail about what's happening Happ here and I'm not that upset about it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it let's move on it's kind of like real life jab jab jab right jab jab Jabs or four Jabs jab jab jab right hook ironically it's like give give give by the way day trading attention was originally literally up until the final hour called jab jab jab left hook it's literally the follow-up to that book part two part two but it got so nerdy and it's the most detailed marketing book I've put out that I I it just felt like it was different it was more of what now I realize I've been doing for 20 years which is day trading attention and what does that mean and first of all I love the day trading part obviously yes um I would love to know what long-term attention investing is but date explain to me what the concept of day trading attention well listen to what just happened in the meta right before this part you told the audience in our relationship through the years I've had an ability to be like I think this is happening I think this is happening and obviously you also know cuz you've been in the game there's many examples of that with me whether it's YouTube or Twitter or Tik Tok or just a a lot it's been the story of my life day trading attention is the core asset in the world is attention for governments for parents for businesses for for media companies it's attention and the history of the world attention platform distribution evolves so if you wanted to sell something way back when you probably had to draw something in a cave and other cave C men walk by it and we're like I need that club you know and then obviously newspaper and radio right I think a lot about that I studi newspaper and radio transition to television a lot and have a lot in the last 20 years I think a lot about this classic political story where JFK loses the debate on radio to Nixon but wins the debate on television which was a new medium he goes on to win the election sting correct nion looked like crap JFK was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] St and so I and then I was also born in the Soviet Union so I'm growing up in the 80s during the Cold War the end of it and I'm thinking about propaganda and and I've always been fascinated by even weird things like coupet Tas like when you're overthrowing a government why they why they would always go to the newspaper and radio station at the same time they would go after the palace somewhere at a very young age I understood communication mattered so and then obviously I was very affected by it I had a small family liquor store business that I was coming into that I was very very very and I mean very hyperfocused on building a very big business for my parents and I was like I'm going to do this for a while and then I'll do my own thing and I got very fortunate the internet was just emerging so all of a sudden I launched wine library.com in 1997 there's not a liquor store on that has a website in America there's literally three or four at the time there was three or four of us and and I watched our family business go from A3 to a $40 million business in a nanc AKA 5 years with no money I didn't raise VC we didn't even have a credit line on the business this was all using its own cash flow and I did that through email marketing while every other wine store in the country was doing cataloges so day trading attention I was getting attention in 1997 and '98 and 99 from people that worked on Wall Street that were early to email signing that came up and sending them a daily email about Opus One and chatau Le and I was outflanking the biggest stores in the country at the time Zachy and Sam's and and and K&L out here in California these iconic wine stores that I looked up to as a teenager that I would used to buy the New York Times when I was 15 the Wednesday dining in section and look at their full- page ads one day I'm going to be like them they're spending four to months making cataloges spending lots of money making the catalogs so they were spending more money and they were slower than I was I was spending no money on email or the distribution and I was doing it daily so I was getting to the customers the biggest wine customers in the country and selling them Insignia and cus and Silver Oak and chat Le and then two months later they would get a catalog for morel's or Sher leman's with that same stuff for more expensive and they'd already bought it for me and so I was able to outflank the entire industry with a new medium which was email and having a website and then later when we met that was starting to happened because I saw this thing called YouTube and a couple months after it came out I started a wine show right and and and then obviously social you change the name right of the yes the store was originally called Shoppers Discount Liquors and then we rebranded it to Wine Library and and so I was very affected by day trading attention which I Define as right this second as we sit here there is overpriced and underpriced ways to get attention you could run a Super Bowl ad for this podcast it would cost you $20 million between the media the production CBS would force you to buy other inventory in their ecosystem that is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] inventory it might cost you more than that so that would be a bad idea even though the Super Bowl is my favorite ad so you say though in your book that it's still undervalued I agree with that with all those millions of with that I agree with that and I think if you're Nike or Coca-Cola then that is going to be a good idea cuz their marketing budgets are enormous the only reason that's not a good idea for you is my intuition is you're not spending $20 million a year promoting this not yeah that's right and so but if you are spending $1,000 or $100,000 or 500,000 you want to spell spend it as wisely as possible right and so to me right as we sit here and record today the the number one thing that has happened in marketing is that organic reach in Social has changed in the last couple years compared to what we grew up with when we were growing up with social media it was more more like email marketing you would get as many people to follow you as possible and then when you would post a percentage of them would see it today one clip from this show has the ability to get 10 million views on Tik Tock and another clip from this exact show might get 4,000 the creative is the distribution now with these algorithms and that is a substantial massive massive land grab that I want people to know about and there's a million others whether it's influencer marketing or Hulu pre-roll something you should be doing is running ads a video of this on what is now modern television you can buy Hulu ads now for if you have $100 and if you put that in front of other Financial content that's awareness just like pre-roll YouTube has been established so these are all the things running through my mind all the time but what is undervalued and what's overvalued right now because when you were also promoting Wine Library you bought AdWords and you thought that they were overvalued but they were really undervalued at the time the The Clarity on that let me jump in is I bought them so cheap like day they came out at 5 and 10 cents a click that when they went up a year or two later to like 40 and 50 cuz other people were doing it cents 40 and 50 cents I was like oh it's over right I cuz I was like damn it used to be so cheap I didn't really know at the time what CAC and LTV was I didn't think in terms or had thought about customer acquisition versus lifetime value I inherently did I was like if I invest in my business we and we're good at what we do we'll keep these customers it'll work out in the long term but I didn't have the math down yet so to your point what you're referencing is I wish that I spent more money on Google AdWords in 2001 2 3 4 5 it was that I was so damn early that I got I got confused and tricked my own self that it was like oh it's over now like I should have still been buying those things at 50 cents a dollar even $2 cuz they were worth it to the business they were just two like when you bought the word wine for 10 cents on Google and we the first result you can imagine when that word went to $16 a couple years later per click you like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what I didn't know yet was it was still worth for my company to pay $16 cuz the client was worth more or that could go up to $100 like you don't know where you are in the corre part and so I think people think of Tik Tok right now and say like I've missed it it's too late like I can't put my steak in the ground anymore in the same way as like you know maybe you thought that you were at the peak of adws but it was just in the middle you don't know until you zoom out correct and then there's a game of best there's not only is it underpriced but then are you good at the creative so is it harder to quote unquote go viral on Tik Tok today than it was four years ago when I was yelling about it on every platform yelling yelling I know it was pre pandemic and you wanted everybody to go physically first that's right I it had already happened so I knew like the thing that has worked for me is I don't predict cuz I want to keep good reputation anytime I'm yelling about something it has happened I'm just there early enough that it doesn't feel like it's happened but to your point like what's really fascinating now that everyone needs to hear is you've missed nothing today somebody will start a YouTube channel YouTube has been rocking and rolling since 2005 right for last 19 years today as we're doing this right now somebody will start a YouTube channel and they will go on to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crush it because they were better that'd be like saying well there was no room for Billy ish because Madonna and Cindy Lopper and Whitney Houston were pop star and all the pop star opportunities are done it's a merit based game on the creative and so no medium not podcasting not YouTube not Twitter not Facebook every one of them is fertile ground for best but best takes creativity once things get overpopulated what went F what what skill set creatively it took to go crazy on Tik Tok four years ago today is the mundane that doesn't mean you have to be crazy uh it means that you have to provide something new and different that has depth the other thing I vote back to for giv flowers here the other thing that I always thought was going to work for you was the depth of what you were talking about you were talking about Subs of stuff the stuff you were saying was right financial literacy continues on this day as we sit here to be still way underpenetrated from what I wish the world knew so the other thing that people need to hear that I think has been very substantial for both of us us is you can have Sizzle and we both have Sizzle that matters Charisma ability all character that happen but if you do not have stake you have no chance of longevity back to that South by Southwest I remember the keynote I gave that year I remember cuz I used to read every single tweet after every talk I gave and I remember many people during that era thinking that I'd be gone in a year or two because they thought my over-the-topness was just stick and like all Sizzle no steak and I remember enjoying that back to like cuz I knew that no no I'm doing this forever like I'm a real businessman like I think I like at that point already i' had already accomplished things I wasn't guessing like I knew I had the work ethic and the talent and and so I really think that people need to hear like if you're thinking about starting a podcast or you think you miss Tik Tok or you want to do a YouTube channel like there's nothing stopping you do I believe that the next big platform that comes out if you move fastest on it that you'll get even more upside if you're good of course it's just supply and demand of attention but there's never a bad time to go on a big platform if you're good enough well I say that about investing too like you're never as young as you are today some people say they're too old today is as good a day as any or you miss something right to that same point if you missed investing in a good business and you're like damn I should have bought it at $18 a share now it's 42 well guess what if it's actually a good business I mean I remember people telling me that they missed out on Apple stock in 2011 really really right you know right I mean Facebook I've I've I invested in Facebook 4 years before the IPO I've never sold a share it opened at 42 went to 19 a lot of the people that worked at Facebook at the time at the six-month lockout sold at 19 it's 500 that's wor because you don't know where you are in that chart that that part and what are you yelling about now I do love live streaming um but I'm yelling about twitch for a different reason I don't need to yell about twitch twitch has clearly long established that it's important ninja popped on Twitch seven eight years ago this is nothing new clicks aen R all this Stu and I know aen on Kick but streamers have won what I'm yelling about with live streaming is I see something really interesting I think there's a new genre coming that's going to blow people away which is what I will call the mundane people that are streaming almost like an ASMR of something like I I I I said something the other day I'll say it again I believe someone uh I'll use an example I believe in the next 10 years there's currently a hairdresser in her little Salon six seats in a small town right now she's got a nice big business she's a killer I admire that entrepreneur a lot the fact that she is on the maybe she's listening right now if she puts a laptop or a camera in her salon and starts to stream the day literally I believe that that person is going to become famous and make a lot of money by not playing to the camera by core activity like triming show style that's right now now I also used an analogy in a recent podcast that I I'm really excited about I believe a stay-at-home mom and dad is going to stream their 6: a.m. to 8:30 of cooking cleaning up the kitchen and getting the family ready for the day that that will be the stream and that person will go on to make seven figures what I wrote about and crush it which has come to be true I didn't call it influencers that humans would be able to make money on what they were passionate about I believe is about to happen with streaming that I am encouraging people that are listening right now that if you can stream the mundane the mundane I I used another analogy if you mow your massive lawn for 3 hours there's going to be a big movement in the next 3 to four years where live streaming of what seemingly is not interesting cuz don't forget you were there you remember what everyone said about Twitter everyone was like I'll never forget this when Twitter when I was yelling in 2006 and 7 about Twitter and when we at these of conferences everyone was like this is so stupid who gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if you're having a pizza nobody cares that you're walking the dog and I remember in a Q&A session at South by somebody went really hard at me said this is actually idiotic and she she was it he she said Gary you seem like something was kind of like clever in how she posed it you seem like a smart guy do you actually like who gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about what you're having for dinner and my answer was everyone and the whole I remember the oxygen coming out of the room like that moment you know when you're just like a mic drop and it was fun because half the room was like couldn't like comprehend what I was saying and I just remember looking at certain eyes and energy and obviously people I talked to after I got off stage it clicked for a lot of people my belief at the time was what is now transpired it's how human communication works and and when somebody was listening right now probably brething to themselves while they're on the treadmill or driving listening right now or walking their dog and hearing me saying that I think somebody who owns a small Salon will make millions of dollars through ad Revenue subscriptions and merch and books and speaking after she accomplishes what I'm saying that someone's going to make millions of dollars a year only by live streaming what she's doing Monday through Sunday now which is just running her business I think people struggle with that leap but it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crystal clear to me so how would you start doing that you know there's only one issue at hand in this entire conversation which is is it okay for privacy of the other people that happen to cross paths with what you're doing so if you're a person that works at home all day a a painter if you paint if you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] paint put a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] camera and go live and paint obviously for the salon woman the thing that's a concern that everyone's going to have to figure out out is you know a salon is like a therapy session so if she's streaming her day and a woman's coming in and she's doing what she normally does with her with this Salon person who's been her salon hair stylist for 11 years that's now her therapist if she's now complaining about her husband to that person obviously that's live on the internet that could cause some so so a lot of people are listening you're going to have to figure out the Privacy thing two things on that one a lot of people are going to be fine with it they'll adjust they'll like I can't talk about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about my husband here cuz it's being filmed number two a lot of people are doing solo life but again I'm going to say it nice and slow I don't think a lot of I'll give you one one of the biggest most important uh really admirable jobs in my opinion of when people come to First World countries is they clean homes a lot of immigrants do that right it's something you can control you can do that job without speaking English or Chinese or whatever place you're going to man obviously again very challenging I listen to this I'm an immigrant I'm like I'm going to do this tough to live stream from the home that you're cleaning for someone because you're showing someone else's home but do I believe that if you were able to get over that hump which might be too surmountable in this scenario that somebody could go from getting paid some sort of hourly wage there to becoming famous yes I do and I think that that's the next Frontier of what's gonna happen well it's almost like a boomerang though because didn't lonely girl try to do this and well lonely girl was and I was there in early YouTube and I'll never forget when that popped lonely girl was weird because it was a show but we didn't know for the first couple weeks if it was real or not so it was like Blair Witch reality real world they did such a good job that company cuz you thought she was a real person cuz that was the days of Z Frank remember and retto and like and uh rocket Boom and that was just a very I mean first for everybody's listening first two years of YouTube was bananas it was yeah it was like 90% pirated content right from the late night shows and The Simpsons and then a bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people like me all trying to figure out like this might be something but I guess from a business owners's perspective this is what I struggle with and I remember being on CNBC we'd have analysts come on who were always available to come on TV and we were like if you're always available to come on TV like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you doing like are you really a big fund manager cuz like how do you have time to leave whatever you're doing and come on TV and I think about the same thing with social because I'm running a business and so I'm supposed to be on all the time but like I'm KNE deep running a business and so well it's why I suck at streaming right now my streaming cuz I always want to if I'm going to talk the way I'm talking right now I need to taste I'm not talking from thesis or hypothesis or Professor land I'm streaming my office right now my problem is is I'm in such operations mode between V friends and Vayner X right now that my day-to-day is so godamn boring I'm literally sitting at my desk literally doing 12 straight hours every minute on minute of meetings I'm operating and the entire stream is on mute because the meetings I'm having are sensitive information and so I unmute for a second be like thanks for hanging out guys but like so the to answer your question a couple things one there's Ways to Be Clever when I started realizing that I wanted to Vlog and I was like oh Casey ni said that's so amazing but I was like I can't do that so I took and you probably remember this I took a crazy step and hired dck right and that became a term like I need a dck like that was very early one of the I was one of the first people that had a human being following me around 24/7 I remember you first before that didn't you have a human trainer following you around and take yes that was the same time that's exactly right in first I literally started this is true I literally started vlogging drock following me and Mike fanti who I worked out with this morning virtually that was 10 years ago when I started getting serious about my health um it's happened at the same time I had two human beings following me around one was filming me and one was making sure that I wasn't putting non-need carbs into my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] body so explain to me like let's double click and take people behind the scenes of this operation so you're live streaming onute how does that look where are you streaming how is it working tell me about your twitch.tv/ garve everyone can go see it it's it's literally a camera I mean I'm looking at the camera USS right now there's a camera I'm living my life again I'm not doing it well I'm doing it to really taste it right I think that there's uh in twitch you can raid someone's channel that means when you're done live streaming you can send all your uh viewers to someone else the team found this woman is it the pizza lady that we send is that a husband and wife or what's their scene I think it's just her and her boyfriend and they have a pizza shop yeah in Rochester in Rochester New York and they're just like there's a camera just of them behind like the kind of security camera right like you just see them making pizzas all day we've sent some of our audience there so I know the team likes her stuff and him and like like it's what everyone is listening to is thinking it's that so but then how do you run a business successfully and also make sure you're doing content all the time cuz you're like content content content well I was going to answer why those analysts were probably either one of two extremes either very smart or what you think which is faking the funk right anybody this goes back to the premise of the book if you're one of the top hedge fund operators managers or whoever you had them private Equity people or Public public CEOs they were extracting the attention from cmbc and you could listen I am very busy but if I am given the opportunity to have 30 or 40 minutes or 17 minutes especially with zoom 10 minutes that I allocate to that level of awareness of what I'm doing that's Roi positive so CNBC is a no-brainer the ones I'm more skeptical about is like they're on every little thing that has like 19 viewers but even that they might be smart about one of the main reasons I do podcasts is a for the attention of the audience which is happening right now for the recordings of it for my own content I like doing two for ones you know I love public speaking cuz I enjoy it right it's lucrative for me but luckily for me it's become not Roi positive to the amount of time that I need to allocate for it one of the main reasons I still do it there's only two reasons I still do it I genuinely enjoy it and I want to do it occasionally it's still fun for me and two I need content I have a problem to your point I'm so operating right now that I don't have enough content and so I need to actually allocate time for podcasts or Keynotes or other things just to have content creation cuz my life is my production facility I love a twofer I love a twofer deal so what so what does that look like and what about the people that are maybe faking the funk on social media that are like I'm making millions of dollars in one day and L that well you know you know that like I mean I think if you're rich you don't have to to say IR rich but it's become more of a trend to say look honestly I don't even think about that because this goes back to what we talked about earlier that just plays itself out you and I have been around the block at this point a little bit we've seen people come and go and so like you know look um as long as no one's massively hurting someone you know like really bad stuff then it's just becomes like I surely I have no feelings towards anything that someone's doing might be faking the funk cuz they're you know from my perspective you know honestly I go to compassion I'm like I hope they get into a good place where they don't have to do it this way so explain to me who's on the team now meaning what happening like for this twofer what are we doing Dustin's recording there's we have about a 25 person team at this point I think bunch of international people the content goes into a hub and we go through the content now more than ever starting to use AI tools to go through the content and pick out the moments that we think have validity or upside to be meaningful short form content and a way we go and I distribute through every platform I think what's unique about me still is there's not a lot of people who go Coast to Coast from Snapchat to LinkedIn and everything in between I post on every single platform at scale every day Facebook LinkedIn YouTube shorts Tik Tok Instagram all of them Twitter like all of them and you have that distribution plan that goes out automatically somebody's doing it what tools are you using is it on aana what kind of AI yes are we just switching from aana yeah I think so um everything you just said and again like like literally human beings with tools project management tools editing tools whether it's cap cut or adobe or whatever it is honestly I don't even I'm not even close enough to it anymore because it's really those things are agnostic what's what the key is is creating scenarios where you can capture content and then putting as much talent or science against the ability to extract those individual creative pieces and then under what I wrote about in the book this concept of pack what I call pack platforms and culture right so one of the reasons I love let's go very nerdy and deep into details one of the reasons I love the green this is something you could crush I apologize I'm not sure if you're doing this or not green screens you would crush green screens it take so long no it doesn't that's so weird you say that cuz green screens is one of the biggest reasons I well I I do mine on Instagram but I I mean I don't let me rephrase I reacted the way I reacted cuz it's one of the few things that I can do fast get a headline of something I have an opinion on put it in the green screen filter flip the camera look at it speak my piece for 60 to 90 seconds and send it to the team with copy and we're done I see but not like several Cuts correct correct got it if you're talking like the Alex or like that that no not that not that's that's different that's the I don't even know what the proper terminology for those stop Cuts like that like that which is amazing I've actually been talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for six months with my team I've been wanting to do a show like that with those hard Cuts called uh winding down where like I do my recap of the day while reviewing a bottle of wine clever name right uh but to your point that it's hard I've been talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm like I'm going to do it I'm going to do it and I never do it cuz it is but you know especially for me after 10 11 13-hour day to like then go and do another that's how I feel that's hard green screen is different green screen is an image or a video that you get that runs in the background of you being at the Forefront of right a green screen like and for me I actually use a lot of mainstream media headlines and talk over it that's been huge I was about to say why that's huge cuz that hits on the C in pack pack stands for platforms in culture culture is pop culture and timely pop culture matters right and so if you can speak on social commentating on what's going on and then if you understand platforms are is a carousel ad better than a reals should you post in text should you do you know Instagram over Tik Tok or the answer is always going to be both but how does YouTube shorts act differently than Facebook reals like there's a lot of science to this and there's a lot of AI That's changing the game like what are you guys using is it Opus or nvo like can you give us some nerdy blocking and tackling you know what's funny I don't think we fully like we're just onboarding all I'm thinking about editing tools all the things you just brought up or chat GPT or things of that nature um our mid journey and things of that nature they're they're supporting tools for thinking we haven't really fully like we're on one of the big things I worried about and the reason uh we have been slow to using all of them was the terms of service a lot of these AI companies were very spooky to me because if we ingested our content it wasn't clear if they could use it for the overall platform which as you can imagine was something I needed to Think Through by the way on the record it's not like I'm scared of that because I think it's an inevitable outcome I have unlimited content on the internet so anyone can take it ingest it into an AI tool and think like me or do me I get all that that doesn't scare me it was more of when the law are written by America the EU the the world is going to have to address this issue when it's written I just wanted to make sure that if I it's one thing if someone went on the internet and took my stuff and did it if I self deposited it in I wanted to know the to we're finally in place where it seems like the AI tools are starting to write terms of services where they say and we have no rights to this you can use our tool but it's not like we can ingest all that information and do something with it so what is scaring you with yeah the same thing that scares me with anything in life nothing scares me per se but the thing that everybody should always be vigilant on is what don't we know right that's all like you know this thing that scares me with AI is the same thing that scares me with sugar there was a time when the world didn't understand sugar completely now there's a lot of Science and understanding that a lot of sugar leads to Dementia or Alzheimer's or a lot of other things we don't want to happen I'm not overtly scared of the robots killing our children but I don't eliminate it as a possibility anything can happen I just don't demonize new technologies I look at the optimism I don't think about all the jobs that AI is going to take out I think about all the jobs that AI is going to create when everyone cried about the car being invented which was something people cried about they said look at all these people in the horse business that are going to go out of business this is real stuff I mean there was God I I I hate this I always promise myself don't forget the number because then you can use it and I can't remember it so I'm not going to make it up there was a shocking amount of people in the in the United States of America whose jobs were directly correlated to horseshit I'm being dead serious the amount of people in Manhattan Chicago Pittsburgh Cleveland Baltimore that's job in life was to go around the city and clean up horeshit cuz horses is how we moved around there was articles written about this car is terrible what are all these people going to do the tractor when the tractor was invented ni the amount of people that worked on farms in this country and this world was insane it put them all out of business you know what that meant they all went on to do more profound things everybody who's going to lose a job because of AI in the next decade not maybe that exact person cuz they may be in a life cycle where they can't but that person represented as an 18-year-old is going to do a different job for example let me give you one that is going to be a massive job prompt engineering the ability to be good at asking AI questions is going to be a skill set so for every kid that is going to be like oh my God I can't do Adobe design anymore that's not a job I remind that kid first of all I'm old enough to know when that wasn't a job either you took the job of the people that used to do it on paper when I was a kid so I think people get caught up in these things without realizing how the world has worked forever but how does that change like with Viner media right it becomes a potential vulnerability so what's the balance between put people to manage this stuff or do or do Brands even want to work with agencies do they I don't know but I'm not scared of that I'll put myself out of business before I let someone else do it meaning I will adjust to the reality of the game by the way I can't cry about that we built one of the largest global independent agencies in the world by making videos and pictures and marketing and social media and we've taken that money directly out of the da Drapers of the world every dollar that Vayner media has is a dollar that widen and Kennedy or crisen Porter or oie or Leo Bernett or mind you know share or starcom had so if I'm taking from someone else I can't be a hypocrite of Something's coming along that might take from me this goes back to the earlier energy I don't think that I am entitled to benefit from entrepreneurship I think I need to respect entrepreneurship and be a good entrepreneur and then I will reap the benefits of it it's actually my biggest problem with fake entrepreneurs that make a lot of money and then go use their money in politics to try to change laws to keep their money I don't respect it because I think that they're a loser I think that they used to be a young lion but now old lion and instead of being honorable like Obi-Wan Kenobi and just letting yourself get killed they go try to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do politics and change the I the level of cynicism and judgment and I don't have a lot of that in me but there's something so romantic of pure entrepreneurship to me that I really get disappointed when I see people start from Little or people that start with a base and build it big and then when they're done being in the arena cuz they don't have it anymore they're tired they didn't put in the energy that the Young Bucks are doing they go try to change laws in America to benefit them that's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] loser I can promise you right now that will never be a chapter in my career if AI is destined to come and kill me I will Obi-Wan Kenobi that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I feel like you're never leaving the arena there no chance and by the way I think that's right comma if I want if I wake up one day at 81 and I'm like you know what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it I'm leaving the arena this now has my attention or this will bring me Greater Joy then that's how I see it not let me go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] be an old dude who's going to use all my power and money to like make it good for me to continue to make money when I don't deserve it you don't see that with athletes wayang Gretzky is still not playing hockey right you you the Merit of the game is respected and too many people in modern capitalism like I don't good you've got more money cuz you figured it out like the cynical let me phrase the Counterpoint to what I'm saying which I've heard from people that I've said this right to their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] faces No that becomes the game and I'm like cool if you think so but that's bringing no value to anybody but you okay so we're not going to see like Senator you're not going to you no that's different that's being a politician you probably won't see that either but what you definitely won't see is a Viner super pack that bans AI because I'm scared that it's going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up Vayner media that you will not see well you see V are good public probably not I'm too focused on not having to worry about the short term I think the biggest reason I will never be a public CEO is I have no interest in appeasing people that think it's interesting to judge businesses in every 90day window it's also a pain in the ass yeah it's it's also stupid like when you're bu when you're running a marathon let me rephrase that's not fair it's stupid for someone like me who wants to do the game in perpetuity if I'm playing in perpetuity why would I succumb myself to something that is a short-term game if you're a marathon runner you don't do the 100 yard dash so I think private is so fun I get to I get to have bad years last year wasn't a good year for Boehner meaning it was a great year but like I should have made a lot more profit but I just decided to go in for the jugular and I'm investing like crazy and I invested like crazy and so we made a lot less profit last year than let's say the would have wanted me to and I have no interest Nicole to sit in front of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people and be like all right everybody let me tell you why my stock is going to go down this year because I'm building this forever and I'm going to hire more people and Advance my best people like like do you know how crazy that is like watching public CEOs Pander to hedge funds or analysts who are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Excel jockeys on what they're going to do for the next 90 days or this year like business is so simple you're either extracting out profit or you're investing back into your business like I don't I don't know how I feel like you and I like our old school like this is what happens when your parents are immigrant it's like I just believe at the end of the day you run a profitable business like period the end you make money or or if you're really building a great business like like when everyone was razing like I had only bought a couple public stocks in my life and one was Amazon 100 years ago because it was just very clear to me like Jeff BAS was going for the jugular he gave a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about customers and he was reinvesting in his business and they were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on him like I would have cmbc in the background and people like you're not profitable tell us why like what like what how you don't need a lot of brain power to understand they were going for the jugular it's one thing to waste money it's another thing that you're losing market share cuz someone's outflanking you but there's just such clear indication that some people are going for the long term and I think I think I would struggle as a public CEO I don't think I'd be good I agree I'd be fired real fast if if I I would be smart and probably not give the board any opportunity to fire me but I wouldn't enjoy it because I might not give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if my stock went from 52 to $39 but Dustin would and that would be pressure on me i' feel it would be hard for me to feel bad cuz you know people would be like yeah cuz people like so I I just don't think I do well at it so speaking of Dustin how often are you on your phone like you how often are you actually checking social media where are your boundaries um well you know it's funny like things have been flow because I'm so office-based and like very meetings based right now I'm not on my phone a lot believe it or not because I'm so in meetings I I literally Nicole like my normal Monday through Friday is something like 8 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. somewhere in that range to minimum 700 p.m. straight booked in meetings every minute and then I have dinner meetings right and so like you know it's hard for me to get a lot of phone time in on that um but when I'm traveling like definitely more but I'm checking social media for the P what I talked about in the book pcsing post creative strategy I'm looking for s of I read the comments to the content I put out to help me inform what I'm going to put out next or where is their value what didn't I see that people like or you know so I am spending time on it but less right now I'm really in meeting life I really like how you talk about you know raising kids in this world and saying that they're not going to avoid it you just have to teach them self-esteem and confidence for someone who didn't get self-esteem and Confidence from her her parents just asking for a friend uh what would you say to those types of feelings of depression and anxiety around being social so much well that that's incredibly normal like there was people who who were older than us that had massive anxiety watching Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous and Ma massive Envy watching MTV Cribs and the reason I brought up those two things is I'm trying to get the parents that are listening to realize envying people of wealth or status or perceived happiness is not a new phenomenon right and so I I would say that's that makes sense I think for everyone who's listening right now who has Envy or anxiety or things that nature that's a natural human trait that's part of almost everybody's journey and as someone who has the reverse which is why I have such admiration for my parents and my circumstances you know I would tell you that the quick you get into a place of just loving yourself regardless is how fast you're going to start being okay with it and here's what I mean by that I think the biggest issue in the world right now is that we put people on a pedestal that we don't know and I'm one of those people I people like I get I get my emails and my DMs and I'm very grateful I'm flattered but what I want to remind everybody from me for damn sure and anyone you could be thinking I I actually want everyone to I don't know if I want you to close your eyes but I'd like for everyone to really think about this I mean like like in the room I want you to think about who you admire that you don't know right like real talk Rihanna LeBron I don't know right I okay like let's do a dramatic pause for a second think about the person good do you know how many things they suck at do you realize that they like they have right this second a child a brother a sister a parent that could sit with you for an hour and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on that person so heavy for what they're not good at what they don't do what like this is human life I think for the people that you're talking about which is almost everyone who's listening why are you putting someone else on a pedestal and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on yourself now I know why back to the vulnerability and transparency you're leading on the circumstances of one's life led to a place where that was part of the framework I watched my I mean I knew my dad's mom very well my grandma Esther may she rest in peace I love her with all my heart but this was an extremely negative woman like at a Central Casting from the Soviet Union like everything you can think of and so it's very obvious to me watching my father when I got to really know him in my late te and then my entire 20s and 30s where we spent all our time together I understand why my dad is different than me I had a mother who built me up and she had he had a mother who tore him down and we both ended up successful because that's what happens the extremes of both lead to success I obviously what I want for the world is for more people to get to Success Through happiness and joy than insecurity to prove to right when you come from that place you know this intimately based on what you've shared you're so driven to succeed to consciously or subconsciously show everyone Stick it to everyone it comes from you know it's it's it's funny I brought up Star Wars already it's the of the dark side versus the force they're actually very close you can be both Darth Vader and Yoda they're actually both very powerful deep insecurity and deep confidence not ego ego is insecurity with makeup on deep actual confidence and content and deep insecurity both end up at the top there's just one big difference the first one can stay there when you get to the top from Deep insecurity [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gets really gnarly fast the reason we've seen so many people grow and crumble is cuz money and fame and success do not change you they deeply expose you and so one of the reasons a lot of my content changed 7 to 10 years ago was ironically books like the one I just wrote I would put out such black and white exactly what to do opportunities and I would watch the world that at least was on social media at the time and I would wonder why people weren't w't doing it or why they would stop and start and then I had my Epiphany probably in my late 30s which was oh I'm in a good place where I can handle the criticism the the micro losing the sustained discomfort and all these people can't oh why is that and that got me on the Journey of like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I got fortunate like DNA and parenting and Circumstance perfect storm this makes sense but you know I think one of the things that people always find weird when they really get to know me is my great passion is my career I love it it's my game I love being I love working the way people love skiing or cooking or playing golf like it's or going on vacation it is my favorite thing to do I love it but what I think stuns people as they get closer and closer to me is I don't get my validation from it I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about it I love it it's my game but it's not who I am and I think I'm trying to figure out ways to put out information that might help people realize why that's good you talked a lot about your parents you talk about your grandma you don't talk a lot about your kids no you're a great dad like I know in in real life but why is that I think too many parents are putting their kids on blast without their kids wanting it I'm a very well-known person at this point in my life I don't want to force my kids into notoriety if they don't want it period some people think like oh I have to be so authentic and transparent and show all the things like you don't show all the things I don't show [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right I I uh I think that's unfair to children now I I jumped in real hard here I do not judge others I don't think any I love talking talking about parenting in the macro I hate talking about it in the micro I am not saying that every parent that's doing that is wrong they might be 100% right right I don't know their children I know for me um that it's very important that I don't do it for them and so I think it's I think it's not understood yet because we've never lived through an era where everyone has the potential to be known and I think that there's a lot of children that will end up resenting their parents for putting them on blast like that and there's other children that will learn so much from it it will be awesome I just don't know the outcome of mine and I'm not willing to take that risk can we do a little game I'm always up for a game I'd love to do a bullish and bearish game bullish and bearish heard yeah okay meta bullish Reddit bullish alphabet bullish wao I'm not educated enough to give an answer on that to be honest Nvidia I feel like again not educated it feels like I I'm just not educated enough but it definitely feels like it's so hyper big that I'm like I feel like if I spend 10 hours educating myself I'm like okay this is not sustainable to be this crazy Disney Disney very bullish and I know I know Disney Gets dragged into politics a little bit but I think intellectual property is one of the most underrated businesses of the future of VR and everything I don't think people understand how big owning IP is going to be Tesla Tesla bullish Microsoft very bullish I've been very impressed with what they've done the Last 5 Years open AI is I'm going with very general like I'm not saying their stock price or anything is that what you want me to do whatever I want I'm I'm bullish gbt uh Amazon very bullish Zoom bullish Alibaba bullish bite dance Tik tok's curent company bullish even though it might be banned a a pimple in the ass of the overall thing still create content bullish yeah okay coinbase bullish not a company but nfts bullish but I understand so actually this will be a good pause because I know that one probably caught people off guard given where the brand of nfds are everything I just said bullish to is you've asked about very contemporary front-facing going forward businesses right like like some of those people may have changes I was thinking very heavily when you said those companies who's running them right now so but every one of those companies is on the right side of History right now the world is only going more teched out advancement it's not going backwards right so you know what's really fascinating about that is if you're a Legacy Media Company you can only win if you make very smart decision ISS right Liberty Media buying Formula 1 you need to make that kind of level of brilliant decisions to stay ahead of the curve cuz your business models are getting crushed right being a cable network tough business right now no more free money from bundled subscriptions so so far the ones you've talked about are all going in the right direction they may not have the same stock value they may have bumps in the road they may get lapped but they're all right now heading that way nfts is different the reason I said that I'm bullish on it is because nfts have just gone through the recalibration of short-term greed right just like internet stocks had to do that in the 90s late '90s internet stocks pets.com was worth billions of dollars with zero sales the market was right that the internet was going to be big it was just everybody got ahead of their skis the reason I said bullish on nfts is I'm going to click this in 20 years because there's going to be 5 to 10 nft projects that are going to be the Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol and Pokemon and Hello Kitty of this generation I work every day feverishly to make sure vriends is one of the of those things I want it to be the Sesame Street meets Pokemon of this era and I know right now even though I don't know who she or he is I don't know who they are but I know for damn sure there are two artists right now making nfts that in 20 years everyone's going to collect and they're going to be the most sought after well people got confused with nfts I don't know and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if I did I promise you I'd be buying them and you know what's cool about nfts it's on the blockchain people would see that I'm buying them so it's like a cool world but I would say this where everyone has nfts wrong is the following nfts are stuffed animals nft projects are Beanie Babies so nfts is a macro genre and so everybody got caught up in the up and the down and but at the height of nfts I was making content saying 99% of these are going to zero and I did it because I wanted to be again historically correct and I wanted people to hear what I was saying about why I'm bullish on nfts but do I think nfts is Collectibles just like trading cards 99% of trading cards are worthless Michael Jordan's rookie card is worth hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars 99% of trading cards are worthless but Charizard the best Pokemon from the first time is worth tons of Money sneakers 99% of sneakers don't sell on stockx but the 1% watches 99% of watches are not worth something in secondary Market but 1% is and art 99% of art that's made is not Rasheed Johnson it's not Jackson poock it's not Monae same with nfts 99% of collectible nfts will be worth zero but the 1% for the next generation will be the collectible of choice the Way digital work and that's why I'm bullsh on it it'll be the lefit that's right back to thank you for that I'm I'm sad at myself and way to pick me up 99% of wine is not collectible right it's drank [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] within the year that it's made and it people drink it this weekend for Easter right at the time of this recording um but but 1% of wine is collectible and and that's where people got the nft thing wrong but it's really interesting what you asked I love having a mix of bullish and bearish but I struggle to not be excited about the companies that are at the Forefront of Technology every most of the companies you just mentioned have such an obnoxious advantage on AI and then I'm even scared a little bit back to government involvement because people are so scared of AI a lot of these biggest tech companies might really get lucky where the government's going to pass certain laws around Ai and they're going to be sitting there nice and pretty cuz they're going to be the ones that control it not the open market I'm concerned concerned about that so let's drink about it let's drink about it let's drink our concerns away let's drink our AI away okay so I heard that b is your favorite B burgundy so I have this bottle I don't know if it's important or fancy it's it's important and fancy and good I'm very impressed Alexandre is a really good producer uh it's a it's a single Vineyard the whole team I love this it's a single Vineyard Baro it's from 18 this is the right glass I get a little anxiety so first of all I mean I know I'm not to the mic I'm sorry but let's talk about glass are there are there ideal glasses yes cuz they work well with the the oxygen that needs to come in but I just want everyone to hear this I have drank plenty of very expensive wine in my life out of a plastic cup let alone the perfect glass like the one the one thing I've really hated my whole life about wine is we intimidate people with it it's another thing we use to make people feel insecure right so like all you need to know about wine is do you like it that's really the actual truth DUS sure yeah oh Dustin likes wine yes for sure everyone's all of a sudden everyone's coming out of the Woodworks the good wine gets poured I'm good all right so we're going to play a game Financial never have I ever okay remind me how I have to play this never trying to remember never have I ever if you have done something drink if I've done it yes got it okay never have I ever maxed out a credit card drink if I have done it never have I ever split the check on a first date never drink if I've done it split the check on a first date never no way uh leas a car leas a car yeah if I've leased a car only only that's his uh fought with the significant other about money have I fought with my dad you mean like a spouse or or like a family significant other oh definitely not no signed a prup if I've signed a prenup I have to drink I have to drink I to bring up you're such a romantic gambled in Vegas oh yeah here's my most frivolous money thing back to me not being very attached to money as a matter of fact I used Las Vegas from 21 to 26 big shout out to my great buddy Rob Muse I worked all the time as a kid the only thing I really did for myself was Go to jet games on Sundays which really worked with the store schedule but I would always take one weekend a year and go to Vegas at 22 23 24 25 with Rob Muse and I was so sure of where I was going professionally and I was so into gambling at the time one time I lost like 40% of all my savings in a weekend it was only like 20 it was a lot of money at the time but but like I really and then I lost my love for gambling something happened where I couldn't win enough to get excited but I could lose enough to be upset I really haven't truly gambled for about 10 years now yeah this it's not for money it's for the Jets this color for you thank you yeah no it it I used to be willing to pay for the entertainment I viewed it as a deposit I'm going to go to Vegas I'm going to lose $7,000 and that's going to be awesome that's a vacation then it just changed and I haven't been there but anyway go ahead spent $1,000 on a bottle of wine if I've done it yes I think I have um it's good wine it's good wine overdrafted my my money no I'm an immigrant like like we don't even like we don't we don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with that my dad didn't even accept forget about him having a credit card this is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] insane you want to talk about being propaganda Sasha Sasha not only did not have a credit card like when normal people did in the early '90s our store when I started working at Shoppers Discount Liquors did not accept credit cards wow cash check and now do they accept credit yes I mean the world you know I was like Dad like cuz I would be at the register and people would like leave this was like 1993 people would like leave this they would only have a credit card even then they would like leave remember checks CRA uh never have I ever disputed a charge on a credit card if I've disputed a charge on credit card I got a drink this is something that's going to make everybody I I want to be transparent on this podcast I'm not going to drink but I view this as a weakness of mine this is because I don't look at my credit card statements my whole life I'm sure I've been charged for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now I'm need some running rehab well that yeah well listen here's the thing on that I I'm so offense bad at defense like to your point that's I I preface it by like please if you're watching that's not a cool I'm not cool that's wrong but I did it the majority of my life and then I got to a level of wealth where I have my financial team around me and they're doing it for me so I'm good but I've never done it never have I ever had buyers remorse on a big purchase never have I ever invested in a company that went bankrupt the majority of the companies I invested in went bankrupt never have I ever invested in a company that became a unicorn so if i' done it yeah drink drink drink so I get to drink of this one never have I ever felt like I had enough if I felt like I had enough then I drink yeah oh I can drink the whole bottle I this is the best part about how my life works I am uncomfortably ambitious comma and also and also I have always been satisfied it's really cool it it is you know Nicole it's funny that just really hit me in my chest like I I really do feel guilt of how lucky I am of how I'm wired and I do believe most of what Gary ve is is me trying to give back out of some way to like deal with the fact that it really broke for me and I don't mean financially you met me when I was far from what I am now and you remember how lucky and happy I was and I knew people there's so many people in my life that knew me 10 years before that and 10 years before that it's always been there I've always been deeply satisfied while equally obnoxiously hungry and that's a great place you know hey everybody I wanted to say that a new book is coming the followup to jab jab jab right hook originally called jab jab jab left hook but I
