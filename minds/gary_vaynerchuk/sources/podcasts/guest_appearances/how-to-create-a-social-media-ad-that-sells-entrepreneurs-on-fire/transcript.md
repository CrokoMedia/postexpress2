# How To Create a Social Media Ad That SELLS — Entrepreneurs On Fire

there's a dog walking business listener right now she wants or he wants more clients if I can get them to start allocating another hour to five per day per week to just making content that's organic but when they make it they think about the different cohorts people that have more money than others gender race some people have parents of kids with athletes so they'll make a video like hey are you a parent of a kid that plays soccer or basketball or some other sport every weekend I'm the dog walker for you now all of a sudden you're posting that now that the algorithm is going to find people more likely like that then does well now you start running ad dollars on it not up front attention is the number one asset Gary you've always said that attention is just a major focus of yours but the problem with getting attention is it can be quite shall we say expensive so can you share the ways that we can get underpriced attention in today's landscape I can first of all John I uh I just want to give you some flowers um podcasting is obvious an incredibly important medium in the world today and I think it's potentially lost in history that you were one of the dozens that was moving first and hard on it and I just want you to have that because thanks you built on underpriced attention you went all in on podcasting as it was emerging and I feel as though you deserve credit on that so I wanted to say that and to that point that's the game this is why I'm obsessed with social media marketing the most underpriced attention in the world right now is sitting on social media organic creative right the way the algorithms work now social media is not the one that you jld and I grew up with it's that one was based on email marketing get as many people to follow you as possible and then a percentage of those people would see your content when you posted it right if I had a million followers on Twitter I would consistently get more views on my videos than you if you had 50,000 and I would stay within a general pocket now the way it works is the content itself is the barri ball and so I may have 15 milon followers on Tik Tok like I do how many do you have jld uh 175,000 the fact that you can make a better piece of content than me tomorrow that has the best practices first second thumbnail copy understands the culture of the slang of Tik Tok I love that all your videos can get more views than my videos cuz the Merit of the creative is the game and that level of underpriced attention where there is no cost for distribution and there are some costs for Creative depending on how you do it um is by far are the reason I'm obsessed with social media marketing and for both brand and sales and I think more businesses creators influencers podcasters small businesses SAS B2B B Toc companies need to get professionals need to get way more serious at being remarkable at day-to-day Social cuz that's the organic thing for big Brands listening Super Bowl is underpriced media it's underpriced attention for 7 million $8 million $9 million you could buy 110 million people watching a 30second video that's impossible anywhere else there's influencers that you can do deals with that are grossly underpriced there's overpriced influencers uh a Super Bowl ad becomes overpriced when the creative 30-second video stinks and nobody acted on it now you just wasted all that money so you know there's there's a lot of there's a lot of ways to get it but my favorite underpriced um attention games right now are event marketing and sponsorship when done right um Super Bowl influencers and creators and at the tippy top perfect organic social media what I love about this personally is that this gives hope to the listeners who are like you know what I have this passion I have this Micro Niche I'm willing to go into and dominate and create the number one solution to a real problem in this Niche create remarkable consistent content around that and I can win as a result and solving a problem if I may just jump in cuz I love the way you frame that but I want someone to hear this solving the problem is I might just be the best communicator on Zelda video games and I'm and I'm entertaining and informing when people hear solving problems they think about things like what I do I'll make you better at wine tasting I'll make you better at marketing tactics I'll make you better at having a good relationship with yourself in perspective I'm proud of those three things but there are many other problems to be solved escapism entertainment uh um many other things to learn in detail like landscaping and cooking and and makeup tutorials so when when JL D says Solving a problem I just want to make sure people understand that Eddie Murphy solved problems in the 1980s he was entertaining and a comedian and for 3 hours if you went to his standup or went to watch one of his movies or two hours he allowed you he was solving the problem of life is hard and he was taking you out of your day-to-day struggles and putting you in a world where you laughed and laughed and smiled and that brings incredible value to you as a human so solving problems comes in entertainment and education and information and pondering and fantasizing for you know there's a lot of ways to quote unquote solve a problem and to give flowers to a mutual friend of ours Pat Flynn was also a major Pioneer in the podcasting space and guess what four years ago he's playing Pokemon with his son who was obsessed with it and Pat's like wow there's something here I'm into this and I'm a Creator I know how to do certain things video wise content creation wise that other people can't do in this specific space and he went on created this YouTube channel big pocket monster or deep pocket monster I think it is and it blew up he has almost a million subscribers he's throwing a huge event in San Diego he has way more knowledge and information and followers around that space now even though he's only four or five years in then he did does around smart passive income which he launched back in in 2008 so I mean this is just an exciting time that we're in right now and one thing Gary that I always talk about on this show is story I I love to say there's a reason why history is his story her story we're built around story so share with us the science of Storytelling o the that's a great question look I think there's a lot of different ways to build a story the hero versus the villain um Things Are going to be okay at the end of the day the the shocking surprise ending um the you know like what's amazing about stories is all of us can relate with different characters like you think about Star Wars there's people that relate with Han Solo more than Luke Skywalker with Princess Leia more than Darth Vader with Darth Vader more than Obi-Wan or Yoda or Chewbacca and you can go on and on like you know for example I um I'll give you a good one one of the people I most relate to is Rocky Balboa oh and the reason I really relate to Rocky Balboa is because he lost to Mr T in Rocky 3 because he did lose everything and went back to the slums of Philadelphia in Rocky 5 or six or whatever that one was you know I like a story that has not only in a part of a film but in the actual whole film that talks about adversity or starting from zero again or dealing with death right in in the in the many Rocky films we watched him lose his mentor we Lo we watched him struggle with his relationship with his son we watched him you know we watched him lose his wife who is like rocky rocky one's a love story Adrien I'm getting Goosebumps Adrian Adrien to me is like you know especially like someone who like desperately loves their mom and like always kind of put like female um you know tenderness and strength on a pedestal even before it became fashionable um to some um you know Adrien is so big for me and yet she dies right Lion King when I saw in I was on a high school date with a girl and I cried in the middle of you know crying in the 19 1994 in the middle of a theater as a senior in high school around a Disney Animation is not necessarily the coolest thing to do but like the story captivated me so much and because I loved my parents so much and I was able to put myself in the story and then all of a sudden my dad dies that hurts my feelings like you know stories are amazing I tend to associate with a story where the lead character is not only dealing with adversity but I wouldn't say is enjoying adversity but is um is coping and dealing with discomfort and navigating and fighting and moving forward I also associate with the superhero that gets punched in the face by The Villain Like spits out his tooth and then looks back at the villain and says now you're in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] trouble because I have that gear in me right like when I'm pushed to the edge my greatest luck from DNA and parenting and circumstances I fight back I don't fold like a cheap chair so I associate with that person but my mother may associate more with somebody in a story like you know Steel Magnolia and the mother figure like you know like and so the element of a story is is it relevant does it associate does it make you connect do you see yourself in them uh and are you a concise Communicator stories come in different ways when you review products like I did when I came out the gate and this when you first saw me yeah I talked about wine in such a different slang than anyone else did before rap and hip-hop is a storytelling medium that they did it the Pioneers in the late '70s into the early ' 80s when it was really being formed they did it differently than music had been done before they talked about different stuff than we had heard before and so you know there's the communication style there you know as you also know cuz me you PN and others we grew up in that 2005 67 internet era you rem this is going to land with you I was like an interesting character cuz I was a little bit more Jersey than like the business world had accepted I dressed casual and I cursed and as you know if you think back that really worked for a lot of people but for a lot of people it was a turnoff it was too aggressive and I always understood that but I always felt that if you speak your truth you'll be in a better place than trying to conform to something you're not and so the art of a story to me and the Art of stories is are you authentic to yourself first you know Jay again I think this will make sense cuz we grew up in that ER together a lot of people CAA speakers a lot of our friends at different events they told me like Gary if you just take it 20% down if you just took it down a notch you'll be so much bigger and these are people you respect these are people that like at CIA they're like showing me emails exchanges with people that say we'll pay him $20,000 more we'll pay him $40,000 instead of 20,000 for a speech but can he can you do a couple of speeches not cursing and can you wear a suit can you tweak him a little bit and you have to respect that that's the market talking but for me it was more important for me to be authentic to me and to myself and it allowed me to feel more comfortable to tell the stories for me when I spoke it was less about me wanting to make as much money as possible it was more that when I was on stage I was I was obsessed with being historically correct that what I talked about about Twitter or Facebook or YouTube would become true because then I could trade on that reputation and that matters to me time and time again you've been proven correct cor over the years which brings up Tick Tock ification what is it and what is this impact on both content creation and brand building everybody should be inspired on this call because what we talked about earlier with my 15 million followers and your 175,000 and Pat Flynn going to Pokemon versus profiting and me going to business instead of wine and all the other things we'll see through the years the fact that it was harder to amass a million followers on YouTube subscribers for Pat than every single person listening now in this new Tik Tock ification what does it mean J the actually let's play a game what have you not shared with your audience that is a hobby or like a mic or an emerging New Passion of yours that you've picked up in the last three years give me anything pickle ball okay first of all thank you for saying that cuz I own a pickle ball team I know uh so the fact that you right now should forget about could yeah should make a pickle video maybe a green screen from an article where you add your two cents or literally go outside and just like film yourself hitting it and then come over and be like is anybody else like making new friendships and like whatever it is whatever it is that you should post that on your Tik Tok tomorrow because that content will find the pickle ball audience not the business podcast audience now it may get 40 views but it also might get 43,000 but more interesting if you're profile is set up properly with a link to your podcast and who you actually quote unquote are professionally besides pickle ball somebody may see a pickle ball video and agree with you that pickle ball paddles should be better or that the best thing about pickle ball is exercising with your grandfather or whatever it might be but then they're going to be like oh I like this I agree with this guy and then they're just going to look at your profile and be like what's this podcast like you will literally more likely this is real talk this is like crazy this is if like we're having a Consulting meeting I would say to you brother once a week minimum five times a week pickle ball content on Tik Tok uh and YouTube shorts cuz they have you know Instagram's harder I'll get in in a minute but I think you would pick up more subscribers for this podcast because you started adding pickle ball content to your content than the reverse I do garage sale content New York Jets content wine content business content branding content parenting content now a ton of vend content um which is my Pokemon meets Sesame Street and for some people it's too much and they're like ah Gary he's all over the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] place what is this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but the way the world actually now works is it's finding its different cohorts and audiences and that's because of the tiktock ification what we talking about earlier anyone listening right now can post something on these platforms and get 100,000 views whereas for 15 years if you only had 49 followers on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram or LinkedIn or YouTube well you got seven or nine or 11 views now everybody listening right now can create an Instagram Facebook YouTube shorts you know snap Spotlight Tik Tok and I recommend all of them and posting these algorithm based you know feeds LinkedIn just announce theirs people that have never posted anything about business on their LinkedIn write one article or you take a clip from an audio clip from your podcast from this episode Post in your LinkedIn and you may on 20,000 new people that consume it of which 147 sign up for your podcast this is how your podcast would grow Fire Nation I hope these are spitting the wheels in your own mind about your brand your building your attention which brings us to day trading attention Gary because we have 5 minutes left I want to make the most of it when you write a book it is the first thing that's on my audible wish list the first thing that's on my Amazon Wish List I read it I listen to it I do it at the same time because it's just always entertaining great meaningful content so talk to us about day trading attention thank you first of all we have 10 minutes cuz I want to milk every second with you two thank you and I think the reason you do that and the reason of people that have haven't heard about me in a while or hearing me for the first time or have heard of me and like who is that guy anyway like I think the reason jld does that is I have enough of a track record 15 years in of I'm a of the moment and then I'll write a book every 3 4 years of the moment this is really the followup to jab jab jab right hook jld so like day trading attention is we so okay we've established that organic social media is definitely the answer for everyone here but now the question becomes which platform so for example I know most people that are Advanced at social media content that are listening right now are are doing either a podcast and then chopping up some clips doing YouTube long form or most like have Instagram and Tik Tok as their core with a little bit of with Twitter and Facebook potentially being the next year with almost nobody taking LinkedIn as a social network or SnapChat Spotlight as serious alternatives to these feeds YouTube shorts different than long form also mailed in by too many yet I know every person here whether they're trying to build their podcast sell more roses at their flower store get more people to use their auto body shop get more people to consume them as a thought leader and buy their courses or programs that three or four of those seven platforms will come more native to them everybody should be marketing on more platforms and what content you put where and how do you do it and what I call pack platforms and culture when you make content is the variable of their success plain English there's a dog walking business listener right now she wants or he wants more clients I know that Facebook or organic if I can get them to start allocating another hour to five per day per week to just making content that's organic but when they make it they think about the different cohorts people that have more money than others gender race what side of the tracks do they live on this neighborhood some people have are you know parents of kids with athletes so they'll make a video like here I'm just going to go very detail for this audience yeah hey are you a parent of a kid that plays soccer or basketball or some other sport every weekend I'm the dog walker for you now all of a sudden you're posting that now that the algorithm is going to find people more likely like that then if it does well now you start running ad dollars on it not upfront I go into very deep deep detail J D remind me did we send you the galley or you don't have it yet don't have it yet when I when I tell you when you get it right when you listen to me reading it on Audible or you you uh you get one and I think a lot of people are going to end up cuz they like when I read it and I go off script are going to get the audible but then they're going to realize how many times I'm referring to the book with the with the charts and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so I think people are going to buy this book and it's more of an evergreen book what even if someone as advanced as you because I have a 2000 person Global agency the thing that has happened the last seven years with me that I think is under the radar as my notoriety and my awareness got bigger um is i' the whole time I've been building Vayner media V this you're going to be impressed by this I think Vayner X now is 2,000 people globally is a $350 million business I'm the active active CEO of the company so not only do I and as you know over the Last 5 Years Gary ve the brand has gotten bigger not smaller so I'm personally a practitioner of this but I also have the luxury of seeing my agency spend billions of dollars in media you know charge hundreds of millions of dollars to make pictures and videos and creative for it and I watch how the Fortune 500 Works versus the companies I invest in I see how the emerging Creator Brands work like poppy or prime or beables you know I'm me and I'm watching and I so the level of detail I went into this book when I think about somebody buying a book for $28 on Amazon which will probably go down by the time this comes out in a month or I don't know when you're going to air this it's probably out now but it's probably under you know how Amazon works it keeps going down in price until it finally hits its launch date I'm obsessed with people getting value for 20 to 30 bucks I'm so Peace of Mind in this book because every chapter cuz I go into every platform or every thesis post creative strategy reading every comment after you post or all these things every page has $30 value but the answer comes into that dog walker does she know that she's more comfortable in being in LinkedIn and talking professional versus being on Tik Tok and maybe being a little quote unquote cooler does she understand that Instagram is competitive now with day trading day trading is supply and demand Instagram has so much content right now posted on it every day and some of the attention has fragmented to YouTube shorts and to Tik Tok so now all of a sudden unlike four years ago it's harder to get get reach because the attention has moved meanwhile Elon any moment now is going to relaunch Vine which was the original platform for a short form video and the people that go there first and go ham on it especially people that look like me that already have audiences elsewhere they're going to get underpriced attention because there's not going to be as much content made at first for the amount of people that are actually on it that's what happened on threads but threads didn't really stay right so it was awesome for a month and that was great for me I crushed underpriced attention on threads now it might be proper attention because there's not enough attention for the amount of work you put in but for me I'm going Omni channel so every channel is something I'm going to trade on but I'm a psycho and I'm going for broke for somebody who's got a small business and is trying to pick a platform or two couple things you should be on many more platforms use the same video but in the book I'll show you and I'll do it right now or if you can't afford the book go to pyate Bay steal it I don't care but like get the information in your head because the first second of a video on YouTube shorts should be different than the first second and thumbnail and copy on a video that you put out on on on Facebook because on Facebook you know it's going to skew older on Facebook you know it's going to skew a little bit more local family Vibes whereas YouTube is more of a search engine where Tik Tok is more trending and cool which is Instagram which is more like the magazine and the establishment which is Twitter where it's a little bit more like you know contentious and political like every room is different every every platform has different things carousels versus reals everything's got best practice is per video but you can record one video and get six posts out of it but the copy on every post needs to be different the first second some of the hooks some of the slang even you might have to make two different videos one for under 35 one for over 35 cuz you in the video want to use different terminology different analogies if I make a reference to The Cosby Show in my video of why I'm trying to make a point I'm going to do that for 45 and older and that same thing I might make a you know if I'm going for 35 and under I might make a Nickelodeon hey dude reference and if going for gen Z I might make you know a reference to 310 baby or the or the rap battle between Drake and and Kendrick and Rick Ross so like context the obsession with context the obsession with distribution what are the platforms caring about Tik Tok live they care so they're giving you more awareness this is real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] science bro I go really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] deep of in a 2-hour podcast let alone a 35-minute one I can't get there that's what often forces me to write the Books when I write them when I know I'm like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I need 300 pages to help [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on this Fire Nation you can hear the passion you can hear the fire and Gary you're so kind to really squeeze out every minute that we have together cuz I've seen your schedule it's back toback I remember when you used to do those videos where you would actually show your whole day cuz people wouldn't believe how busy you were and crazy your life was and I used to watch every one of those just being like man this guy is a beast he's an animal and that was like 10 years ago and you're still doing it it's unbelievable so finish with one word authenticity why ordinance bring it home you know what's funny I'll use that word and bring that home back to why I'm still doing it people ask me a lot now it's different they thought 15 years ago I was doing it for the money or the fame now they're like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on I'm like I was telling you back then I mean look I'm looking at my book right now crush it let's read the first title I ever the first book I ever put J you know this is the book that put me on the map why now is the time to crush it and why now is the time to cash in on your passion the key there isn't cash the key is passion authenticity matters because if you're doing something that is authentic to you then the audience will know it's authentic to them and that is the key most people don't do things that are really in their soul they're looking to achieve success to put bandaids on wounds they have with their own insecurities their own trauma of the past they believe that money will let them buy things to fix things and I believe at 48 years old that that is false I believed it at 18 but I know it to be true at 48 because I've had the luxury of spending so much time with people that in my youth and even now don't have quote unquote a lot of money and I have tons of opportunities to spend time with people that have way more money than me and some of the most monies in the world and there's no correlation so I think authenticity is why I'm still doing this authenticity is why I'm on this podcast with you I authentically like you I authentically like your audience because I like you and I know that that audience is going to be attracted to you and I authentically love the game of building I'm like you know I wasn't good at Legos but if I had slightly different DNA I would have been the best Lego person of all time cuz I like building I don't like I'm not a general contractor and I'm not a developer in real estate but if I had slightly different I would be an amazing amazing developer I would be a remarkable coach for a sports team cuz I love the process of taking something from one state to a better State primarily based on emotion then built on tactic and that's why I find myself 15 years being public around mindset and those things and tactics this book's exciting for me because I just wrote a book 12 and a half a couple years ago that was very mindset very perspective very macro look what happens I go right back and follow up 3 four years later with day trading attention which is tactical as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I literally was bored at parts of reading my book because it was like so Technical and obviously I knew what I was writing like like I just had to get through it but I was also pumped because I know everyone's different kinds of learners but authenticity matters because authenticity is the only thing that allows sustainability the reason I'm still here JL and you've seen a lot of personalities you and I grew up in the same internet era you've se you know this in 2005 6 789 I was bet on as someone who would come and go cuz I was so loud people confuse loud as not subsi but amongst the personalities that were part of that ero with Miu and back in 2006 78 I like where I sit amongst the 10,000 people that were buying for being successful and important in 2024 I think I've done a pretty damn good job out of that crew I can say without reservation you sit at the top as number one of those 10,000s Fire Nation day trading attention May 21st get it in audible get it in Amazon any bookstore that you want Gary last sentence and then we'll say goodbye when you're 97 years old none of this shit's going to matter so please focus on being happy be nice to people it always comes back to you spend more time with the people you love and find something you love the way I love communicating opportunity and and honestly this book ties to crush it I believe at this exact moment when you hang up at the end of this right now when you stop when this stops and goes on to the next J you know video or whatever or or or podcast I please just understand how you know the world is selling you so much negativity how why everything's never been worse never never everything's never been better if you decide it and so you have a huge opportunity and so if you're passionate about accounting or hairdressing or or RI uh pickle ball or rugby or anything the opportunity to be great at organic social media to then start the process of you living a happier professional life which will bleed into having a happier life is more real than when I wrote crush it because of the tiktock ification and I I couldn't be more interested in you seizing that because smiling is better than frowning Gary I love you brother I love you back thank you the next time [Music]
