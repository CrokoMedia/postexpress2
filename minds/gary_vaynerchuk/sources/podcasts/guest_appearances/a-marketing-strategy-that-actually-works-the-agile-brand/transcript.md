# A Marketing Strategy That Actually Works — The Agile Brand

the fact that most people on Earth can make a significant piece of content if they're capable and reap the rewards of it without amassing an audience for free is remarkable yeah every piece of content now is an individually judged piece of content on the Merit of its creative and what it brings the audience and that allows people to quote unquote go viral or get incredible amounts of reach with no cost associated with it rendering us being in the first time in history where the creat is the variable to reach attention is the number one asset when the battle for Consumer attention is fierce and everchanging understanding how to effectively capture and leverage this attention is crucial today we're joined by Gary vaynerchuk serial entrepreneur chairman of Vayner X CEO of Vayner media and author of his new book his seventh called day trading attention and we're going to talk about the evolution of attention and marketing the power of Storytelling and the future of digital advertising so just a few things there um so Gary welcome to the show thanks for having me yeah so let's let's get started by talking about your new book uh day trading attention you know what drove you to write it what were some of the gaps that you were seeing in how brands are approaching things and you know what what was kind of the the impetus for creating it you know it's a great question um I wrote a book 10 years ago called jab jab jab right hook and to this day I get three to five emails a day from people saying man thank you so much for this book it's really helping my social social media content and I'm like man like awesome in the macro principles but boy has a lot changed right right and so between that and the postco energy from the CMO set in Fortune 5000 land has really inspired me because I what I realized during covid was I mean I had hundreds of 15 minute to two hour zooms with most of The Fortune 500 companies a lot of CMOS but a lot of like brand managers associate brand managers top you know Innovation this head of media that like just like a real set and then obviously the G that's the Gary Vayner part of my life and then the Gary V part of my life unlimited creators starting cpg Brands influencers creators um every entrepreneur now kind of wants to film themselves or do a podcast chop up like right there's a new world order and I would argue that we have not gone through many transitions this substantial around attention which is obviously the currency that allows one to Market in or create um you know change of perception at its worst manipulate and so there's we're in a we're very we're really in a place similar to what happened when the radio went from being the primary device in our society to the television and I believe that the cell phone has now completely Tak Tak that mantle even though many of your listeners continue to spend way too much time and energy on planning a television campaign as its starting point I believe that organic social media's very clearly over the last five years but especially last 18 months establish itself as the single most important starting point for any brand positioning marketing campaign and just marketing yeah and so I it just became obvious to me that people are starting to take Serious something I've been pontificating about for 15 years and and it itself has changed the tiktock ification of social media is here me you know and obviously we'll probably go into that in this interview so you know I I F you know intuitively I felt there was time and I was ready to challenge myself my last book 12 and a half was very philosophical leadership humanity and and I loved it and I love doing that but I love bouncing back between macro and micro yeah this is the most textbook like te book I've ever written this is the this is the book that I most think many companies will buy one copy for every one of their employees in marketing and honestly as you know more and more people are realizing almost all their employees need to know about marketing to some degree right right and so I kind of feel like I had it in me and you know I uh I'm just starting to talk to humans that have skimmed it or read it and uh feedbacks been overwhelming and I feel like I might have something here and what I mean by that is I'm proud to think I might have a viral book and what I mean by that is people going to realize there's a lot of meat to this and they're going to pass it on and so I'm hopeful and humbled and excited and was ready to write it because the details matter in being great at this social media marketing is the hardest marketing craft yet most people mail it in or see it as like the 20th most important thing or when they do it they think it's easy they're like post something and make go viral right so you know uh that's kind of the energy my brother yeah yeah no and I I love the book for the you know the reason you mentioned is just you know as as a fairly pragmatic person I I like the the Practical you know the Practical insights and I mean I will say you know writing a book that lasts that you're still getting feedback 10 years later about um stuff that moves so quickly quite quite an achievement as well for the you know and honestly at some level I feel like it's inappropriate which is why I wanted to write another one like there's a part of me that's like H you know follow my social media you're going to get more tangible insights but but but really people that follow me on social I do tend to go very macro to your point my framework in life is practical optimism I'm obsessed with practicality I'm an operator yeah yeah I don't think people understand how much of a practitioner of social media I am and so this was an easy book for me to write but to your point like this is a nerdy book like this was this is is detailed yeah yeah no and I I think that's that's one of the things that that makes it so you know practical today and you you mentioned a a term that that's used in the book as well the tiktock ification of social media so I wanted to just ask you to explain that a little bit and you know what what does this mean in terms of businesses creating content means that everybody that's dreamed of what television can do for the last 10 years which it was not capable of doing is now possible let me explain social media that I grew up with you know I know most people are going to listen but for the people that see the video I'm circling some stock certificates that's Facebook Twitter and Tumblr the first three companies I invested in very early well before their pre-ipo or exit yeah that social media the one that I started being obsessed with in 2006 up until the first 15 years called 2021 though what I'm talking about started a little bit earlier was predominantly based on around the social graph yeah and was done really like email marketing so for the ogs in this call or the ones that still do email marketing you know I had an email newsletter from my dad's win store in 1998 that had 91% open rates not bad not baders ruin everything and we all email too much and now it's 20 30% if you're good but that was what social media was go out and get as many people to follow follow you as humanly possible so that a percentage of them would see it right yeah yeah and that was great for people like me that were able to build communities and have consistent awareness and that was great now what's happened is the fact that most people on Earth can make a significant piece of content if they're capable and reap the rewards of it without amassing an audience for free is remarkable yeah every piece of content now is an individually judged piece of content on the Merit of its creative and what it brings the audience and that allows people to quote unquote go viral or get incredible amounts of reach with no cost associated with it rendering us being in the first time in history where the creative is the variable to reach not creative is supplied with money to create reach AKA we have spent the last 30 years forcing people to see stuff that they did not want to see by spending tons of money on it and losing in marketing and now we can use organic social to get consumer insights to get awareness to get reach to create more relevance because we can make more of it for different consumer segmentations and so simply put every platform that matters right now the 10 that matter the seven that matter Facebook LinkedIn Instagram YouTube shorts Tik Tok snap they allow creative to get dramatically more reach if it's re resonating with consumers allowing us as marketers to extract qualitative and quantitative insights and so we call them smas at Vayner media social media ads and when we have insights both quat and qual we can either turn it into brand formance ads AKA turn the creative into performance slightly with a tweak amplify them heavily with media even more than the 5 million organic or 400,000 or even 30,000 which is more than our normal 500 with media just like you would do a television spot right or print that or take the insights from the actual social media post and use it as a brief to create what we call six socially informed campaigns thus mitigating the risk of the campaign because you got actual affirmation that there's consumer interest in it not focus group or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] reporting that most Fortune 500 companies run on right I mean because I think what you're saying I mean with enough dollars spent right you can quote unquote make something go viral I mean you can make a lot you can get a lot of eyeballs on something but I think it's poent I actually think there's a misconceived notion on that our world the the audience of this podcast and what I do for a living um actually spend a lot of money on media to have it not be seen by everyone yeah this is very important Point brother where you were about to go that I would like to tweak and debate and pontificate and yeah conversate about is just because you spent $7 million by the way on social on digital on linear doesn't mean that it's being seen yeah it's potent you know the biggest disease in this industry is potential reach versus actualized reach yeah yeah every grp every impression every CPM every I mean think about a billboard right how I mean like they're all fake metrics and so what is very real is the algorithms on social media are so good that they're they want to keep you on so they're going to show people with a high propensity of liking this thing the thing and if us as people continue to like and comment and share and engage or spend time looking at it or watching you're telling the algo yes which gives more confidence which allows it to get reach that is a truth yeah good point that a truth brother yeah yeah and so I can make a video that I think is great and I've done this a long time and I trust my subjective opinion but if I deci to spend a million dollars on Facebook to amplify it before I do it organically I'm guessing right right and that's happening every day in marketing and so that's where I'm going yeah yeah well and that's I mean that democratizes the process too right I mean that you know it it allows that person that creates that video you used an anecdote in the book you know somebody creates a video and was you know debating whether or not to even post it and all of a sudden it um you know it it blows up without them spending a a dime on it right and that is like remarkable like that is actually what we as marketers want we W the reason we have focus groups and you know do all this TV testing and AB testing and like is because we'd like to mitigate the risk yeah yeah we are now sitting with the biggest risk mitigator of all time called social media organic while it's mitigating your risk for more campaigns it's also doing marketing and branding right that's thing is being done in boardrooms this is being done with consumer it is the ultimate and yet our industry doesn't have it as one of the top 15 most important things they inhouse it as a cost savings with a couple kids on it right they give it to creative agencies and pay them a fortune for it because they don't even care because they're actually just focused on the television spot or the brand slogan it is the great poison of our industry right now that we do not respect organic social media when it's sitting there and building up our competitors that have far less money in distribution because they're outflanking us on where the attention actually is and what the creative is that is required to get it yeah yeah and so let's you know kind of moving to actually before you move on oh yeah yeah if I may flip the script yeah you skimmed or read it you wouldn't hurt my feelings I'm just curious before question I I skimmed the middle and I read the beginning and the end just brutally honest I like that out of all the things that you consumed in your skim or reading what was most huh or aha in the book um I mean I think it's kind of what you were touching on as far as just how we're still and you know I work I work lot on I don't work as much in social media as as I do in other areas but the I think brands are thinking of social media as another kind of advertising whether there's social media advertising of course but they're thinking of organic as another type of advertising and not thinking of it in terms of you know that there has to be some authenticity and I think you know we're we're decades in now to social media being a thing and consumer they're a lot smarter than I think a lot of Brands take them credit for so um I think it's that it's that idea of um you know just needing needing to not think about it like every other every other medium that's right because every other medium the creative is the variable of success however all of it is supported with media dollars all of which hides the truth if the creative is good or not all of which is being measured by things that are usually proxies not the actual business yeah it's it's profoundly wild and it's um it's really too bad like I I don't believe a single Fortune 500 company right now thinks organic social media is the single most important part of their marketing mix and and skill sets needed and investment of dollars needed and all of them do all of them every B2B and every b2c every B2B company has remarkable opportunity on LinkedIn marketing and it's just I can't believe how many companies spent a million dollars building a metaverse store and don't spend a million dollars on on organic social or how many people have PR traditional PR companies on 50,000 $100,000 retainers for the year to do press releases and traditional PR but don't spend a million dollars on organic social and if you're a Fortune 500 company because don't forget organic socials fasing us as a social media agency the ones that I watch you not only get the strategy and the creative but you get the production of making it right right it's not like classic above the- line brand building where you just get the ideas in decks and then you have to pay a production company to make it right right it's just it's incredibly fascinating to watch but I'm starting to feel hence why I wrote it I'm starting to feel people are feeling the pressure I feel like a lot of people are on a treadmill right now on a plane right now uh walking their dog right now listening to two of us and are these marketers who are very smart but know that they can't they can't get the organization there or they haven't been able to get it there or they don't know how to score it but I think in their stomachs they know this has become a thing and if they don't figure it out soon it's going to become a bigger problem they're going to lose market share yeah yeah well and then you know along those lines I mean you know one one of the things you talk about in the book is you know identifying what you refer to as like underpriced channels and you know want to wanted to get your you know if you could just kind of explain that for the for the audience and and you know what do you mean by that and and maybe share an example I think the whole framework of This Book Is that there's overpriced and underpriced opportunities in marketing and they're not macro statements I think every brand on Earth can can waste $10 million on social media tomorrow yeah if they buy their media like it's television against one asset that wasn't made for the context of Facebook or YouTube or YouTube shorts or snap like if you don't know how to make content for the room you're in and then you just spend a ton of money you can wa people are wasting tons of money on social treating it like television or programmatic Banner buying right right yeah so underpriced channels when the organic reach potential per post is greater then it is somewhere else in Social or traditional for the cost associ ated for making the creative meaning if you can make creative that advertises out to cost you $1,000 because of your agency fee or your internal fee and you did that on Tik Tok four years ago where every post every third post was getting a million follow there's so many people on it yet so few people creating for that demand well that was remarkable today there's a lot of Fortune 500 fashion brands who will spend a fortune on a photo shoot for a single post on their Instagram and we'll get 1,800 people seeing it or 18,000 organic reach but they spent thousands if not tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands on the photo shoot between the talent and the time and the production yeah that's a bad idea because Instagram right now is very competitive and there's more Supply than demand in comparison to a Tik Tok meanwhile people that really know how to make an Instagram post are growing rapidly so it's a there's the skill set and there's the macro so platforms go through es and flows as we sit here today Instagram is harder to crush on for 25 to 29 year olds than snap is if you go to snap Spotlight you can on post by post you will get more organic reach on a snap post because most of the people listening right now are not considering snap the way they consider Tik Tok and Instagram meanwhile Facebook is also mildly underpriced because most marketers don't think it's cool and they don't realize how many 30 40 50 60 year olds are giving plenty of attention to that platform and that also is organically amazing yeah but every one of these platforms can be overpriced or underpriced because if you're not good at the creative It all becomes a waste of time no matter which platform you're on but there's obviously moments where some platforms are really fertile YouTube shorts was really fertile two years ago um if Vine comes back and Tik Tok gets shut down in the US that is going to become very fertile so attenion moves like water and you have to be there to catch it but you have to have the right Cup and the right cup is the right strategy and the right creative output and so how do you you know how do you keep up with that on a you know let's say you're you're working at you're working at a brand and you know by not spending your time in meetings that are dumb good one yeah no like real talk like people ask me all the time like our framework is pack platforms and culture I want to know everything that's going on in these platforms including streaming TVs in including programmatic including print including like I'm paying attention every day if the Wall Street Journal wants to lower the price of a full page ad down to a thousand bucks because I'll buy it right like to me this is not a digital or traditional or social thing there's going to be a day and age in 10 years Brother 13 years 19 years where I'm going to be yelling that social is grossly overpriced because everyone's gonna be doing it yeah and VR or ar or something I can't even imagine is gonna be happening so this is this is not a traditional versus digital game this is a are you best at understanding where attention is actualize attention not potential attention and then do you know what song Jingle character mascot video like do people does everyone listening to this understand that the first second of every video you make on social media is life brother I will tell you right now Greg it's inconceivable to me knowing how great this audiences that they are as religious about the first second of every video they post on every single social platform the way I am yeah but they'll but they'll make a long form video an Anthem video for Youtube and spend a million bucks on it and they'll mail in the first second and it's already over they've already left a ton of opportunity on the table yeah yeah well there's science behind this you know yeah yeah and and to get to that the creative part of this too so you know there's lots of talk about the importance of Storytelling and and authenticity and I think you know tying those two things to actually making the sale right is that's the that's the key right is you know how do you how do you look at balancing those things as well as the you know what you just brought up which is the attention part of you can't wait 60 seconds to get into the story either right yeah I mean you need to win the first three seconds in copy thumbnail and video to buy permission to get them to watch for 60 seconds yeah yeah I mean I make three four five seven 10 minute videos for Brands and myself all the time but I know that if I don't win the first three seconds I'm going to lose yeah but that doesn't mean I don't want to make a six-minute video to explain my story um look I think I think there's a lot to this um and I think that a lot of it has to do with why the original book that I wrote was called jab jab jab right hook and why I almost call this jab jab jab left hook I think that too many people try to do branding and selling in the same asset and I think there's places for Branding and there's places for selling and I think when you're half in on either you're dead so to me when I'm making brand content I'm desperately trying to bring incredible value through the story I'm telling for the audience and then when I'm selling I'm in QVC life yeah yeah like I'm not scared to be like hey I'll do it right now I would like every person that's listening to this to sign up for winx.com yeah right and I'm comfortable to say why because if you drink wine it's better than wine.com or Total Wine or anywhere else it's something I invented for my dad's wine store and like I can say it's because it's there's $80 wines for 20 bucks it's basically group on for wine on text form with super premium wines 365 days a year we look at 50,000 wines to buy 365 and I'm in like full that's like full selling mode yeah yeah and I'm not embarrassed by that and then other stuff will make content I do wine teex TV I brought myself out of retirement and yesterday I did 28 minutes on tear Rosa an a a new Italian white one it's an old one but it's starting to gain momentum it's the white burgundy of Italy and I did 30 minutes of brand I could care less if anyone bought a single bottle of wine I was there to be the Katie Krick Mr Rogers Walter kronite Stephen A Smith I was there to entertain and bring value and bring information and I know that a lot of people that are very nerdy that are listening right now are like writing down tea Rosa what's right right t m a r o SSO like and what's really fun for me is Wine's like media it's underpriced I they taste like $150 burgundies but they're 40 bucks because it's an esoteric grape from Italy that doesn't have enough brand yet yeah yeah well and do you think that do you think consumers I mean I have a hunch that they actually respect the straightforwardness well this goes back to you clearly you know I'm getting a sense of you and I heard you I'm listening to every word you're saying you clearly know what I know which is we are delusional in boardrooms all around the world thinking this marketing is going to work on people right I mean you said it you said they're smart consumers are smarter like this is correct yeah like you're not going to trick people and more importantly we do not make compelling creative every 30 second TV commercial is not compelling all of them Greg all of them yeah spam email is not compelling gamer ads on websites is not compelling currently social media is comp compelling and you know that's because a the ads are native to the platform you don't know you're getting an ad when you're just scrolling through the feed yeah you're not anticipating it the way you are in a pre-roll YouTube even though that's a good medium definitely not like something going to commercial or like when you get an email with a title that you could tell is just Spam like yeah humans are animals we know and I don't think brands are trying to provide enough entertainment value I also think we're getting destroyed on relevance my friend most of the people listening here are involved with brands that have plenty of awareness yeah right right they're losing on relevance and what's amazing about social is you can make 30 40 again I don't know if you caught this because I know you skimmed some of the parts like I talk about cohorts consumer segmentation yeah like you know to me it shouldn't be like we need to go after you know Latinos in America no no no 18 to 22 year old Hispanic men in the Miami area now you know you're talking Cuban culture but you may go 18 to 22 you know Latino men in New York and now you're going Dominican Puerto Rico like these these cultural nuances matter my man yeah yeah and so like when you make so now when you're doing 50 ads by the way all I'm saying is it's the 1950s and I'm doing print ads and Direct Mail ads every day looking at the data to make better television commercials that's all I'm saying right right yeah that's all this is to me this is doing radio and television and Direct Mail day in and day out every day and you using the Quant and qual data so don't forget that means I'm advertising every day I'm not testing and learning I'm not throwing against the wall and see what sticks I'm definitely not spraying and praying I am advertising every day for the sake of better advertising yeah yeah yeah makes sense yeah so one obligatory question here you know where where do you see AI in the content creation process in the Fortune 500 land we have to wait for copyright and trademark law to really catch up like I think us putting like we're not putting out stuff at vayer with that's AI generated yeah because we don't know the source and we don't want to be liable and we don't want to put our clients in a bad position so yeah but it's a foregone conclusion and all the entrepreneurs are already doing it and small Brands and I mean it's technology like it's going to be a way of thinking and prompt engineering and the way one thinks of the creative output and and it's going to be remarkable for the most creative people because they're going to be able to just I'm going to be able to talk into a mic and make a 13-minute video that's going to crush that is going to cost me far less and be exactly how I want it over you know because I can keep editing it in a way that I never could have done with my own creative team internally in production and but like and C it's it's gonna be profound yeah yeah yeah definitely but agreed that it's um in some areas it's it's getting ready for prime time but not not for a lot of the stuff that you're mentioning yeah not if I understand your audience well like lawyers involved like you know what are you going to do if you're if you're you know church and Dwight you're going to put out a commercial and then get a cease and desist from Disney because they claim that some of their IP inspired like we've got we've got a little ways to go yeah totally yeah well um Gary thanks so much for joining one one last question for you here so you know I think a recurring theme here is you know keeping up with what's going on here and you know whether it's uh new platforms emerging or algorithm changes all that kind of stuff it sounds to me like a mindset shift is is what's really needed you know what what would your advice be to those you know SVP CMOS out there listening you know how how do they not only for themselves but for their teams like how do they get that mindset there's a lot that comes through my mind brother let me break it down a little bit here one a lot of parents come up to me because I'm very out and about and they're like Gary I hate that my 11y old's on Tik Tok all day what do I do I'm like take it off their phone and they're like what I'm like delete it you're the parent she's 11 oh but social pressure this and that I'm like yeah okay like everybody Drank in My High School I didn't because my mom momed me same here with this I don't know if this is a mind [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well first of all to your point it is a perspective and strategy standpoint I am in deep belief the most of the svps and CMOS and BPS don't believe organic social is the most important thing yeah I do believe that that will change but I view that this is about the advertising ecosystem you know I talk to a lot of CMOS and they equally say to me Gary I can't get my internal social creative team where I can't get my agency to do this yeah well I'm like just like parents I'm like well you're the boss right you know like if you have a relationship with a great creative a let me pick one that I like admire droga 5 I love David droga if droga 5 is doing your above the line and your your you know creative but also doing your social and you look at the line on them and you're paying $2 million for social and six above the line your $8 million a and you're and they're posting never and it's not their big like you're allowed to say to droga 5 like do better or you're allowed to do like this is how I built Vander media all those big creative agencies we became the beneficiaries of becoming in the IAT to do the Creative social yeah yeah and people saved money they were paying droga 2 they paid us5 they saved 500k we did it 10 million times better because it's our religion yeah right yeah like you're allowed to take it internal if droga 5 is not making you happy and you don't want vain or media you're allowed to take internal and take it external I have a lot of people right now reaching out to me and saying I inherited an internal team it's clearly not good you know like can you help so that so those people made the decision that they're allowed to take it from ex internal to go external internal or vice versa but what I would say is if you found this interesting if and when you read the book you find it even more interesting because it gets really detailed and it gets into creators it gets into product placement in TV shows instead of commercials like I'm really going there there like all like uh sampling as like a marketing strategy trial I think we more of Our Brands need to get people to taste things um influencers can be wildly overpriced or underpriced um you know I go experiential filming it to get content there I mean I'm really really think there's a lot of reinvention needs to be done but I think it starts with everyone who's listening here that has the power to know that social is television now and to two make the changes on their team internally or externally be accountable that you're the big boss yeah yeah love I GRE I say this all the time Boehner's got a lot of headaches and they're all my fault right because I empowered the person that hired the hired like I hired this person and I understand that Sally or Johnny is stinking right now but how did they get there I hired Greg and Greg hired Sally like that's me yeah and I think there's a lot of leaders here listening and like if your social's not great that's on you and if you're reporting internally isn't like justifying it change the reports that's what you did for television right right yeah no I I love it yeah that's great well again thanks so much for joining I'd like to thank Gary
